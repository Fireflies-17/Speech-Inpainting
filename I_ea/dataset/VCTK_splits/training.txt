p339_321|I would love to do that.
p374_028|We did it in one take.
p339_090|In fact, he took it very well.
p339_316|It was an insult.
p339_362|I cannot really commit.
p339_272|It was a classic.
p292_398|Several others were absent.
p339_141|It will be for the committee to decide.
p339_270|It is, but that's not the point.
p339_101|Six men will take the decision.
p376_220|That has been lost.
p339_048|We have to work together.
p339_051|It means it is difficult.
p263_376|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p339_189|The other was a football match.
p339_133|It happened again yesterday.
p339_314|They were following his orders.
p339_417|They are looking for partners.
p339_089|She had to learn a new discipline.
p339_418|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p374_191|The number never came.
p339_296|I have nothing to say on that.
p238_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p339_249|There is a great carry over value.
p233_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p333_103|Maybe he will act again.
p339_052|But they were true stories.
p259_425|It is hard to understand.
p284_415|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p339_355|I thought to myself.
p339_289|I think we could do well in Europe.
p339_378|They still have a great sense of humour.
p339_049|I don't think that he won't be released.
p286_211|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p276_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p339_050|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p313_090|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p339_259|The memory is there.
p339_252|I was very surprised.
p376_207|More cases are expected.
p339_352|My mind is the most important thing now.
p339_224|What's it about?
p339_215|The lottery has helped.
p228_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p339_087|I am not completely insane.
p339_304|He had planned to sell it.
p339_375|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p339_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.
p339_253|We all knew they could do it.
p339_234|The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
p339_342|That's why he is the prime minister.
p257_404|It is simple, but profound.
p339_397|Is it the shape of things to come?
p339_216|They know the language.
p297_170|Which is worse?
p339_114|We're not that bad.
p339_338|This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
p339_110|But it was only a matter of time.
p339_392|Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
p339_166|My condition is not bad.
p263_450|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p339_329|He is in charge on the pitch.
p339_275|This time it really could happen.
p297_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p339_372|Just get on with it.
p339_213|It has certainly paid off for him.
p339_120|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p339_039|We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.
p339_374|It shows the Government is listening.
p339_302|That is exactly right.
p339_081|It all happened so suddenly.
p339_283|There is nothing to be gained from that.
p339_180|A film is different from a book.
p339_033|It really has not been their season.
p339_144|He was part of the family.
p339_086|It will probably be my last, too.
p339_132|We are still waiting.
p246_172|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p339_030|It was really good in the first week.
p364_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p339_265|We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
p339_150|Mind you, all was not lost.
p339_155|It is just a matter of time.
p339_336|It's the body that counts.
p313_180|We won't do that.
p339_399|It is about more than Scotland.
p363_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p339_233|No, they have played well.
p339_208|It is not as simple as that.
p313_076|This was much worse.
p339_149|It was so sad.
p339_077|That should be fun.
p339_395|You can feel the tension in the air.
p339_391|We'll have to be satisfied with it.
p339_123|But there was everything!
p339_136|I am not inclined to believe it.
p295_331|I certainly think it should be there.
p339_369|The night is young.
p339_140|My ambition is to make the cut.
p339_031|It's about the balance.
p339_223|Without doubt, they can win the title.
p339_034|I want somebody with something to prove.
p339_160|He would have done the same to me.
p339_323|It wasn't the issue.
p339_221|You cannot do that in a lobby.
p339_273|This week is a perfect example.
p339_287|What do you want.
p339_109|It was all over now.
p339_251|Police are appealing for witnesses.
p339_124|We are doing very well as we are.
p339_047|The jury is still out on this one.
p339_381|He was at the outset of his career.
p339_400|It's not just going to be busy.
p339_181|Within three days he was dead.
p339_198|I have no problem with that.
p339_236|I'll take it as it comes.
p351_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p339_328|Words are not enough.
p339_211|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p339_318|Referees in Scotland are very weak.
p339_209|Everything in the symphony is there.
p339_202|Lester was like that.
p339_415|I didn't play badly.
p339_261|Nobody has been put on trial.
p339_207|It is not a road of life.
p339_365|This is a new beginning.
p313_075|I'm so worried about the roads.
p339_422|There is no shortage of questions.
p339_127|However, the drama was not over.
p339_341|Let's not make that mistake again.
p339_099|What you sow, you have to reap.
p339_157|I'm not fit for anything else.
p339_244|They have to come up with a solution.
p294_297|The acting left a lot to be desired.
p292_404|What is the Barnett formula?
p339_298|I have no worry about that.
p339_359|It looks as though there is no chance.
p276_150|Are you going to win?
p339_282|No other family members could be contacted.
p339_082|I won't let that happen.
p339_337|Sprinters are not fit.
p339_143|Rangers must be winners, it says.
p339_405|We await a decision.
p281_453|We're all paying for it.
p339_146|But it does not matter.
p312_300|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p339_088|We spoke about a few people.
p339_197|We are going to have a party.
p339_046|That is not the place for her.
p339_410|We have got to deal with it.
p339_128|But it was not just the land.
p374_217|I had nothing to lose.
p339_161|What were they told?
p339_269|They have to live with the risk.
p246_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p339_311|The first time it was rejected.
p339_068|But summer is spent.
p276_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p293_369|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p304_079|Could it be?
p308_105|It separates the men from the boys.
p339_274|However, it is going to happen.
p339_268|Should he resign?
p339_038|You go in there and do it.
p339_250|It was not like that at all.
p339_343|Only injury has prevented that happening before.
p239_387|She asked for the appointment with me.
p339_390|He has run a hell of a race.
p374_244|This was not a contest.
p313_104|We shall be victorious.
p339_102|To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
p339_371|I thought it was a great game.
p339_326|We are going to listen to Britain.
p339_071|It is extremely fortunate.
p336_395|He is a one-off.
p313_118|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p339_063|I am not retaining him.
p313_235|My body is exhausted.
p287_048|The teacher would have approved.
p278_404|I had a fortunate war.
p339_134|He will be a major challenger next year.
p339_361|It could have been a ceilidh.
p339_111|I always liked to get a laugh.
p339_260|It was an amazing experience.
p339_243|I could have been killed on that day.
p295_290|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p339_339|It's a double whammy.
p339_281|I think it has worked.
p339_214|We're not getting involved.
p257_382|It was on fire.
p339_255|Why is this?
p339_322|You'll have to wait and see.
p339_079|What we were doing.
p323_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p255_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p339_248|But that is for another day.
p339_170|The goal is clear.
p293_061|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p339_303|That is not good for golf!
p339_062|Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
p339_262|He will go on the bench.
p339_315|That is an entirely different discipline.
p265_175|They need to look after themselves.
p339_382|Our position is quite clear.
p339_064|The police are not the target.
p313_251|Which, in effect, it is.
p339_139|How can they tell?
p339_406|It's a matter of balance.
p264_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p297_029|I feel strongly about it.
p305_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p339_117|There are exciting days ahead.
p339_290|And yet, there has been no great impact.
p339_044|Labour has been found out on public spending.
p339_332|Well, that was the plan.
p339_188|He loved it, and so did they.
p339_035|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p339_083|Or have they?
p339_203|Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.
p339_373|Germany also said it was unimpressed.
p339_403|She was so supportive.
p339_364|Sadly, so did a couple of errors.
p339_190|They have the players to do it.
p339_419|We should have been rewarded for producing.
p283_001|Please call Stella.
p339_036|There was a ban on reporting the trial.
p339_232|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p339_204|That's a matter for them.
p339_271|It was my whole life.
p339_167|Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
p339_152|It was an amazing time.
p295_242|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p339_029|What is a house without it?
p339_118|We have to put this behind us.
p238_026|The first appeared to be successful.
p347_282|There are no plans to change this.
p339_205|We were never told it was already decided.
p339_358|Thereafter they were again in control.
p339_065|It has affected it, obviously.
p339_412|I don't know how she does it.
p339_257|It was indeed a night to remember.
p313_167|It will not be easy for him.
p339_183|Did they give any good advice?
p250_476|I have always believed in myself.
p339_350|I thought their commitment was superb.
p276_299|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p333_127|It was a disaster.
p339_061|A government is a government is a government.
p339_277|That includes the equipment?
p339_194|This will have to change.
p339_238|We act because we must.
p313_031|I thought it was quite good.
p238_269|It was a bit of a tightrope.
p339_258|There are not too many like him.
p297_316|But there was no time for that.
p374_258|It is a technique.
p339_210|Find them somebody they deserve.
p374_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p259_452|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p339_196|It was a very strong metaphor.
p339_171|Just think about the lines.
p292_150|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p292_399|It is surprising to come back this way.
p339_125|The Scots are great.
p339_226|The signs are positive.
p339_045|he told a producer.
p295_158|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
p339_055|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p339_308|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
p339_360|You have to keep the focus alive.
p339_115|Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
p339_285|But do not rely on it.
p339_037|I don't think the action was a mistake.
p374_280|I am also delighted for all the players.
p339_295|Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
p247_378|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p339_317|Yet there is hope.
p339_084|There is no change in the strategy.
p374_184|But it did not last.
p339_230|It has to be put in context.
p339_256|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p339_092|Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
p339_301|It turned out to have been three hours.
p333_063|I didn't expect to get one.
p241_169|It is too much for me.
p351_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p339_135|That question was never asked.
p339_040|What will happen to them today?
p339_347|I don't want to go anywhere.
p339_389|It is not designed to kill.
p339_416|We haven't come out of this very well.
p339_245|It is very enjoyable.
p339_310|We have nothing to lose.
p339_097|The search is due to be completed today.
p293_080|Sometimes they come off.
p339_028|It's a big mystery.
p374_212|We're very close to being a good team.
p339_237|I think we're the better side.
p374_227|He is doing just that.
p339_072|Today is the first step in that process.
p339_370|But there are signs of a revival.
p339_320|That was a fairy tale.
p339_225|We are looking to the future.
p339_239|There are two mysteries.
p339_154|The hearing is expected to continue today.
p339_387|Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
p313_051|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p339_266|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p339_096|What will it be?
p333_381|There are moments of honesty, too.
p339_206|It is part of our heritage.
p339_056|There are two things we have to do.
p233_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p339_379|It decided to blame the media.
p339_354|This is a really serious issue.
p313_188|His manager blamed the referee.
p339_227|I called it right.
p339_192|He has made a step forward.
p339_408|Everyone can have their opinion.
p339_169|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p339_220|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p339_280|But that's another story.
p339_103|We should not be surprised at that.
p339_018|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p339_276|That sort of thing is long gone.
p339_333|The problem is fairly serious.
p339_057|Are they going to work together again?
p292_348|It gives us something to work on.
p339_222|We will all suffer as a result.
p339_235|The answer is obviously no.
p261_451|The funding is now there.
p339_383|It could now be up to the courts.
p270_438|It would be very dangerous.
p339_042|It was electric, amazing.
p339_058|We need to do that every week.
p339_094|He doesn't even know who he is.
p339_043|I said to him.
p339_193|That was very important.
p339_168|I would like to make an impact, of course.
p339_228|I see it as my job.
p339_165|How can they say that?
p339_357|We're talking to the US.
p339_231|I think we can get there.
p374_282|He did very well, but didn't win.
p250_384|They will fight for everything.
p243_152|Did it work?
p339_407|It is an investment in our product.
p339_404|I'm delighted with our performance.
p339_173|I was very influenced by him.
p339_176|This was certainly not about money.
p339_185|From day one, we were a family.
p339_376|They want it to work.
p339_344|They have to be dealt with.
p339_334|No decisions have been taken.
p339_330|We have expected it.
p339_105|We have been so lucky.
p339_156|This news is really depressing.
p339_067|And he's not a bigot.
p339_172|It all depends on the wind.
p339_294|But it will not work again.
p339_313|No-one can take it in.
p339_254|It's about taking risks.
p374_173|The rest is his own.
p374_264|But what did it matter?
p374_243|We can make a difference.
p317_238|He did not report it.
p292_363|Glasgow is far from overload.
p293_395|This is a completely new experience for me.
p229_230|Who was on the panel?
p339_129|I don't think the referees are against us.
p339_219|The quality of work is very impressive.
p374_152|That's the important thing.
p323_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p339_121|We're very, very happy.
p333_309|Was that not awful?
p339_148|Sadly, he has a point.
p339_409|What would you ask?
p339_126|That imbalance was evident in their play.
p261_433|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p295_026|She was on the edge of breaking point.
p298_291|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p339_348|How do we get a bigger stage?
p339_388|I cannot describe it.
p339_158|The day may come, but not for a while.
p339_386|So far the weather has been very pleasant.
p339_414|Now we must look to the future.
p339_284|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p283_399|It has only been rumours.
p339_423|Couldn't see the point.
p339_054|I will make that point tonight.
p374_137|Now, that would impress the kids.
p339_288|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p287_407|I decided to take my time.
p305_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p339_200|I'm very happy that it exploded.
p339_346|So what was he really doing?
p339_151|We were extremely lucky.
p339_159|The enemy was time.
p374_196|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p299_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p339_263|The police are hopeless.
p339_305|We know the goals will come.
p339_413|I saw it later in the news.
p339_182|You'll find out on Saturday.
p339_363|There are many questions to be answered.
p308_205|We have chosen for the patients.
p339_069|Services are being expanded, too.
p362_312|It is good football in Scotland.
p339_053|I needed to get away.
p339_293|I'm not there yet but it is close.
p339_112|I still hope to go.
p339_325|I really have to go now.
p339_394|There is no other option.
p339_122|There could be a possible connection.
p292_394|But that title is a mistake.
p339_187|This could be wonderful.
p339_411|Where do we spend it?
p333_303|I made a mistake.
p248_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p339_278|It does nothing for me.
p266_322|A review is under way.
p313_194|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p339_184|We know that from recent experience.
p276_222|I learned that only yesterday.
p274_075|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p276_139|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p276_176|It took five months to repair the damage.
p266_370|Twaddle is a case in point.
p268_157|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p268_071|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.

p286_284|They must play for each other.
p243_354|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p268_334|Walker plans to return indoors.
p276_121|I am not very pleased.
p276_133|No one person or small group could be singled out.
p238_355|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p276_282|Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
p276_260|They've got some extremely good players.
p313_237|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p274_058|We will pay their bills.

p276_347|You just have to give yourself a chance.
p283_180|They should stop the bombing.
p259_292|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p281_339|Do you think we are a top nation?
p276_403|After the match, do you?
p276_320|We represent a wide range of society.
p239_231|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p252_089|It was exactly four months away.
p334_370|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p239_227|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p248_083|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p276_310|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p276_084|The new deal will now be put to the officers.
p276_050|But not a penny has been paid.
p308_305|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p268_050|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p227_315|His job was not advertised.
p276_373|Brown has always protested his innocence.
p239_114|It is sometimes like that.
p257_418|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
p249_080|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p276_355|Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
p243_122|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p238_151|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p227_087|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p285_052|There was no safety net.
p267_351|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p279_107|Before the game we went for a pint.
p276_171|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p276_141|Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
p236_294|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p247_136|This should begin in October.
p227_270|Did he trip?
p226_078|There could be a way back.
p313_396|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p230_185|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p276_427|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p236_396|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p276_079|I have made that offer.
p276_197|The feedback from them has been fantastic.
p230_175|City sentiment is in his favour.
p301_215|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p276_068|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p268_096|So what is the campaign about?
p238_345|My daughter is an adult.
p239_330|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p238_321|We believe a third party was involved.
p276_192|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p238_208|The refund is fully justified.
p243_112|What are they for?
p252_403|Had this been common practice?
p238_312|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p268_166|They exist in name alone.
p276_302|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p276_076|He confirmed that the document was valid.
p238_115|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
p273_071|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p264_055|How are you, sir?
p236_080|They lived for their children.
p276_391|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p275_219|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p276_051|Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
p278_195|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p252_388|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p243_310|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p276_452|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
p376_092|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.

p276_410|Those overseas offices were great.
p268_077|We have to keep our clients.
p276_258|I felt we deserved the three points.
p232_115|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p239_145|We just have to adapt.
p276_313|We've had great things in the past.
p360_166|A good actor doesn't think.
p270_218|From there, they can go anywhere.
p276_255|Five years later, the deception continued.
p247_131|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p276_317|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p268_377|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p268_310|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p263_308|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p276_461|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p263_258|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p259_171|It's never great to finish second.

p238_396|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p276_418|A, The media has been great.
p276_305|A winter of discontent awaits.
p227_165|We've made a couple of albums.
p238_412|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p238_034|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p274_435|Its failure is no surprise.
p276_364|He worked there for six months.
p247_043|Among them are many criminals.
p263_341|He is married with three children.
p273_195|I won't make an official complaint.
p268_122|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p243_242|What do we want to do that for?
p264_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p276_131|Diversions were put in place.

p267_203|There is no quick fix.
p252_366|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p250_067|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p270_343|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p276_352|I grew up with that in the amateur game.
p276_455|We are aiming for early March.
p300_321|I got a yellow card.
p270_270|how do you get it back?
p238_075|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p243_245|What are you not good at?
p276_115|He was unprepared for this fight.
p276_185|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
p276_104|Context is also very important.
p239_186|That was just one night.
p276_228|I would not say that.
p274_085|It wasn't possible to relax.
p283_265|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p305_048|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p247_419|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p259_299|There's not much money in cycling.
p276_394|He ended up a headmaster.

p278_240|The statement contained no surprises.
p238_402|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p238_435|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p247_275|What form did that take?
p286_083|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p287_415|I am astonished at attack.
p270_272|I think, therefore I am?
p239_090|What do they want us to do?
p279_140|This represents a tough game for us.
p317_071|I've come here for the jersey.
p283_143|You've got to be vigilant.
p301_111|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p286_089|Potions said he would drive.
p345_106|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p238_220|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p276_401|It had so much to do with output.
p238_422|The company declined to comment.
p261_141|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p276_304|Each case is treated on merit.
p238_028|There was a rush of water.
p279_100|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p274_207|It was worth a photograph.
p238_405|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p276_446|He was due to retire in December.
p247_100|And they had a case.

p276_465|We are having a look.
p276_145|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
p273_116|This is a frightening development.
p276_039|Further management changes are planned.
p274_223|Laura is an investment banker.
p276_292|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p270_123|Those people must be accountable.
p252_252|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p238_275|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p276_439|Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
p238_127|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p286_214|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p238_219|Bottling is now the core business.
p240_153|Mr Blair had done well.
p273_139|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p259_173|We have a budget in March.
p259_446|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p276_180|It was a sobering experience.
p259_054|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p276_288|And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
p276_058|And they removed a Borderer.
p226_224|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p308_268|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p239_200|It's been a humbling year.
p276_273|What was the matter for concern?
p295_205|It seems a waste of talents.
p259_248|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p239_294|I saw them last week.
p306_044|We like being the underdogs.
p276_368|I had relied on him.
p276_286|Their extinction is not inevitable.
p276_034|He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
p281_241|We played them off the pitch.
p273_084|He had missed a penalty against the English.
p276_108|People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
p282_047|You had better believe it.
p268_246|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p311_207|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p238_429|Not many people like to do that.
p292_179|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p361_392|They would have to go to the Royal.
p276_377|Instead, he missed the lot.
p238_284|This championship is different from the other majors.
p269_213|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p261_183|Says the Duke of York.
p236_305|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p239_174|As if that is an achievement.
p267_124|It would make a lot of sense.
p276_348|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
p276_132|The Queen Mother is dead.
p268_083|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
p236_158|We did what we had to do.
p276_099|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
p276_414|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p286_219|We should all be grateful.
p268_091|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
p297_038|You have caught a serial killer.
p276_175|These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
p268_187|My father died in childbirth.
p276_443|He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.
p238_171|I've no idea how it works.
p268_060|They desperately want some stability.
p238_177|The changes took effect from June.
p261_344|So what happens next?
p250_154|What happened in that game?
p276_344|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p249_047|He is too weak to move.
p268_025|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p268_190|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p268_345|How do you take them away?
p276_423|You didn't need to pay.
p276_040|I can feel the sound inside.
p276_120|Choice is a good thing.
p270_145|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p276_166|It is a good lifestyle.
p268_175|There's still plenty time left.
p261_126|That would open the gates of hell.
p247_145|You are a gambling man.
p256_236|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p247_045|Everything is possible in football.
p301_176|That will be the sweetness.
p239_360|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p276_412|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p238_358|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p241_051|He looks like an Afghan.
p286_163|The family kept away from me.
p286_165|We will turn the corner.
p282_192|We speak about the performance.
p250_082|I've had it for the exams.
p239_177|There was a fossil on screen.
p286_202|It caused a lot of upset.
p276_424|The might be rolled out.
p276_096|The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
p284_061|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p283_192|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p238_154|They make a selective perception process.
p277_160|My Dad is a hero.
p313_329|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p267_287|was everything done to save people?
p238_155|That's what happened against Ayr.
p276_111|He's been active in Arabia.
p233_056|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p268_295|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p259_090|Why do it otherwise?
p323_072|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p276_315|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p268_138|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p276_386|It must be tough to live with.
p238_025|Smoking is also very important.
p238_110|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p238_320|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
p273_112|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p276_345|This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
p236_139|That view has not altered.
p334_365|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p250_218|It carried a double message.
p236_047|Everything else is a bonus.
p276_195|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p276_156|Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
p276_419|Everything has its place and purpose.
p239_155|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
p239_324|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p257_069|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p276_090|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p259_110|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p264_149|Is it in the right place?
p267_108|That admission is not surprising.
p249_083|Even the one she loved.
p252_202|Do I think about them often?
p238_149|And they all have a vote.
p276_438|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p259_320|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p276_095|He's not getting into any games.
p276_311|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p246_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p276_346|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p240_055|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p286_048|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p257_149|That group reported just before Christmas.
p265_137|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p239_374|That remains the unanswered question.
p238_114|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p270_186|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p276_215|The squad is too small.
p246_154|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p239_035|I might well have done so already.
p238_146|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
p323_389|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p300_173|It has been recorded twice.
p238_417|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p268_352|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p238_393|You will have seen the adverts.
p276_135|Margins are also in retreat.
p267_400|Are they free?
p270_168|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p259_157|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p278_277|He was released after treatment.
p270_225|Does that put pressure on us?
p335_134|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p278_291|Truth is the child of time.
p247_411|Does it matter?
p234_236|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p329_271|I might also completely change the routine.
p261_189|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p252_244|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p276_436|They make the right decisions.
p236_353|What do we do?
p264_231|This is absolutely not true.
p276_335|The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.
p259_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p264_236|Has the conflict started?
p287_043|He will need that machine.
p250_278|They are interior designers and architects.
p343_067|Funding needs to be long term.
p276_435|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p276_085|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
p268_313|I was inspired by two things.
p283_034|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p250_210|And we have the experience.
p250_093|The excitement could hardly be contained.
p276_397|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p252_338|How independent is that?
p238_161|He was just like a godfather to it.
p266_142|She died at her home.
p227_265|And they were being paid?
p230_171|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
p276_265|I would have been shot dead in bed.
p268_076|But the organisers refused to worry.
p239_373|He is obviously very dangerous.
p268_338|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p376_081|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p251_084|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p276_044|This is slightly negative for inflation.
p273_387|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p276_087|Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
p238_391|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p261_171|Why change it?
p268_095|So, did she meet him?
p276_199|But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
p276_036|A fiver and I'll tell.
p227_400|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p276_226|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p276_256|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p276_458|It will take place in July.
p270_324|Does the name matter?
p317_195|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p276_234|It was started almost by accident.
p239_077|He phoned the number in the brochure.
p276_200|However, the problem is the timing.
p276_385|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p276_405|Have I really come to this?
p340_421|We made a world record together.
p227_366|Is it worth it?
p267_378|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p276_408|It has to be enforced.
p343_194|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p276_224|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
p286_200|I'm interested in interesting work.
p276_186|The festivals will be about having fun.
p238_207|There was a fine line to tread.
p276_188|She is in good spirits.
p238_372|But the rally was short-lived.
p271_155|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p238_384|Do I have a favourite?
p276_451|When I was four years old I used to do like this.
p257_431|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p238_067|Then they scored two goals to win.
p276_370|The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
p276_071|Let's not be too despondent.
p227_201|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p238_183|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
p276_253|For business, the benefits will be enormous.
p276_207|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p361_182|I can see it now.
p267_163|Are you from the rugby?
p250_035|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p276_447|We go there with confidence.
p234_205|Was it the wife?
s5_164|Nato has left them with no other option.
p276_250|I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
p268_271|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
p238_223|We were right to be afraid.
p247_260|We have no information on Iraq.
p281_134|I never wanted a legal battle.
p239_383|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p236_276|We accept the new rules.
p276_154|But they must believe in themselves.
p283_327|Is there a waiting list?
p247_141|They made such decisions in London.
p276_213|Some promoters made insulting offers.
p276_420|I have received no explanation.
p238_410|But nothing could be done.
p276_209|It is quite a thing to watch.
p268_212|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p283_241|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p239_221|I was caught out a little bit.
p283_128|From it emerged a cup.
p256_224|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p254_173|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p283_375|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p283_423|I was pleased with my own game.
p283_412|But the foundations have been laid.
p281_370|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p283_354|My life is exactly the same.
p283_173|Today I had no failures in my team.
p271_383|Yet the data is compelling.
p283_231|Consumers have the right to choose.
p230_188|He lives in a neighbouring village.
p273_065|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p283_098|Little is known about them.
p230_163|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p267_195|I suggest a new plan.
p257_173|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p282_228|My wife and family are the support system.
p283_209|She was married with one son.
p248_206|We have an election in eight days.
p275_367|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p234_337|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p283_445|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
p283_292|My office is down there.
p263_118|It was won on the issue of the land.
p293_047|That was the theory, anyway.
p363_399|There is a lack of logic.
p283_413|I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
p283_185|He was in great spirits.
p341_326|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p345_170|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p236_408|The trick is to try it.
p283_468|We are going through the process.
p313_222|If not, he should go home.
p233_051|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p230_253|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p282_157|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p286_088|It's so hard to shift.
p261_415|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p283_460|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p283_110|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p374_371|Sport is good for you.
p360_286|It looks as though he will be right.
p274_202|The early physical reports were clear.
p288_117|There were no grounds for his action.
p283_447|Something has got to give.
p250_200|We always felt we could win.
p334_066|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p283_146|It's not a U-turn at all.
p268_402|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p274_297|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p230_416|No date has been set for a meeting.
p283_036|It is not for any other purpose.
p270_046|I had come back from London.
p283_387|But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.
p248_325|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p283_347|But I think it's different from the rest!
p230_293|I would rather look at him.
p304_156|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p283_323|The Project is far from that.
p305_107|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p227_252|The irony was not lost.
p283_294|I told you I was ill.
p253_279|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p236_149|I was shaking on the blocks.
p270_287|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p249_073|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p267_087|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p251_300|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p238_074|We felt it was sufficient.
p270_249|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p250_245|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p283_408|It proved a good decision.
p273_076|He has been a success this year.
p233_052|I was released after six days.
p374_207|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p287_215|His second was a beauty.
p283_079|It is very special for me.
p250_469|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p263_365|There is a range of employers.
p283_369|Last weekend he was awful.
p265_247|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p259_468|She came to the Highland Show.
p283_298|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p283_275|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p283_035|It could well be the case.
p281_243|This is the year of the Tiger.
p230_257|Nato was not a love affair.
p241_290|A new school will be built.
p334_221|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p283_440|Which may be the same thing.
p253_062|I expect a rapid response.
p270_342|They were impressive against France.
p270_162|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p236_476|I am a committed European.
p313_351|That might help a bit.
p306_124|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p298_392|We have to offer value for money.
p234_043|That means an extra two years.
p340_096|It is a matter of clarity.
p283_424|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p283_290|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p278_232|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p268_249|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p283_090|You have to respect the office.
p247_156|Before it was an ordeal.
p283_153|It will be retained as part of the group.
p283_436|It is based on a true story.
p275_196|I came home by ambulance.
p283_469|Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.
p283_299|The next month is very important.
p230_208|This will take several weeks.
p281_029|It's not going to work out that way.
p287_247|Persuaded to change his mind.
p283_063|He also presented You Bet!
p283_052|I would say the position is open.
p283_142|Last night, the row continued.
p283_451|I do not see it as some kind of reward.
p238_029|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p261_452|But we have built a platform for next season.
p336_421|Let that be their memorial.
p283_459|He was confronted by police.
p273_170|It was a bit like having children.
p283_402|The death rates are still as high.
p249_241|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p283_344|Cast Away now on general release.
p261_416|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p347_089|Theatre is not a museum.
p283_145|We are entirely happy with Russell.
p341_231|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p283_303|It is the end of an adventure.
p287_132|That is the real test.
p295_248|It became a book by itself.
p261_133|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p305_137|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p283_331|The attacker died in the crash.
p305_101|The party lasted all night.
p283_120|There is no credible official announcement.
p246_158|I'd love to be like Peter.
p283_050|Clearly, they had other problems.
p227_215|Who was she?
p283_140|If not, a deal could take many months.
p287_262|They are very keen to work with us.
p304_357|These will take a little time to develop.
p283_279|The minister is the engineer.
p283_119|It's been a long wait.
p261_279|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p283_411|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p283_444|Everything in golf is a balance.
p283_251|The problem was you thought you were a big man.
p287_174|They bought the property four years ago.
p283_216|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p283_443|I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
p254_393|I'm pleased about one thing.
p267_405|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p263_034|The idea is not new.
p270_034|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p283_181|The research was my life.
p292_326|My whole life has changed.
p343_317|I will work on her.
p285_400|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p240_325|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p270_230|There's a chance they might come down.
p347_051|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p227_094|Their attitude is all wrong.
p259_443|My aim is a top six finish.
p283_352|Another reason is a shortage of stock.
p283_392|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p234_034|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p261_394|I am a good player.
p283_211|A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
p230_206|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p283_427|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p283_264|She claimed the day was for young people.
p269_124|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p259_325|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p227_163|Nobody did in those days.
p283_345|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p255_092|We could not get any possession.
p279_319|The airport was even different.
p267_068|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p283_147|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p303_227|It's been a long, long journey.
p240_120|It is a delight on every level.
p283_321|This is the correct decision.
p234_152|But it is different in different regions.
p270_269|I'd never run for them.
p283_438|Being with me is an honour.
p267_230|The boy is no longer with us.
p283_284|You can never tell with the manager.
p275_417|It all began as an accident.
p284_174|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p273_413|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p286_379|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p283_162|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p233_025|We are a service industry.
p293_284|The BBC was a disgrace.
p256_156|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p236_111|The result is a vacuum.
p283_442|We shall not forget him.
p283_252|It was a crazy day.
p283_401|I could not live with it.
p283_372|Ferguson is a good example.
p259_208|He was then replaced by Ross.
p283_039|He is believed to live in Britain.
p283_349|He did that every night I was with him.
p236_331|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p283_049|No details of the talks were given.
p253_052|There is no reason at all.
p274_233|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p281_397|That investment has now been secured.
p273_129|I'm so grateful for that.
p283_385|That can be good for us.
p330_196|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p237_128|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p278_221|January is a bad time of year.
p267_165|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p345_276|He looked like a schoolboy.
p343_289|That is a personal matter.
p247_294|It was never a free kick.
p340_088|There was no hint of scandal.
p267_144|It was by the numbers.
p283_333|No final decision has been taken.
p283_101|IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p311_301|He said he was sorry.
p259_103|It's good to have a voice.
p245_134|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p283_439|He will be judged by his actions.
p268_223|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p317_214|She died in middle age.
p267_228|You could feel the heat.
p265_191|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p237_146|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p236_071|It looks like a hit.
p283_245|It was a great experience.
p286_247|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p234_234|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p295_028|Because we do not need it.
p283_409|Colour was at the core of his life.
p283_336|Well, he can do it.
p279_270|It was an easy decision to come here.
p283_043|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p326_119|She has now been registered as disabled.
p246_290|He will address the nation this evening.
p283_087|I'd like to see the business case.
p283_262|They have not been in touch with the club.
p267_320|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p267_350|I have a moral dilemma.
p257_254|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p286_101|It really was an unusual award.
p270_187|They receive a high profile in the media.
p283_449|If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.
p278_200|They are still very quiet.
p283_365|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p261_153|He was asked to quit.
p273_321|We will listen to any suggestion.
p226_096|However, it did not end that way.
p271_398|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p283_306|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p278_365|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p283_249|This is an exciting time for the party.
p283_285|We need to establish the facts.
p283_304|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p261_413|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p274_465|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p270_447|It was to be inclusive.
p283_463|This morning I got a call from my wife.
p273_132|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p259_387|He had no previous convictions.
p227_210|This is a holy place.
p267_037|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p254_108|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p267_399|That's all I can say.
p302_168|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p283_072|You do not change overnight.
p281_269|The capital costs are modest.
p259_403|It would be quite nice.
p283_132|We would make a start.
p304_146|This is a total mystery.
p283_334|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p263_106|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p283_078|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p259_074|It makes for an interesting conference.
p287_285|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p230_304|I was there five months ago.
p281_229|I'm just a regular person.
p260_292|The songs are just so good.
p283_312|It further expressed his defiance.
p281_383|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
p227_348|In the old days, it was easy.
p270_356|He was at school in Devon.
p283_461|She has reached the top of her profession.
p283_400|Final proposals will be published in February.
p270_426|It needs to be volatile.
p230_328|I would do away with the dress code.
p285_258|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p226_149|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p253_243|My son was too young to die.
p230_141|It has to be an event.
p283_448|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p257_047|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p277_302|We want to play at the worlds.
p363_121|That takes a lot of courage.
p283_158|It has become a way of life.
p340_091|It could be to do with the location.
p361_228|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p261_453|I was embarrassed by it.
p263_113|It should be a great game, though.
p247_332|They come to enjoy themselves.
p270_433|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p283_183|The suspension of the head teacher has been lifted.
p283_070|The Government should be ashamed.
p272_092|By then, he was walking on water.
p258_068|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p283_109|And does it?
p259_167|The woman was his wife.
p258_398|He is on the wrong side.
p283_197|The expansion will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p287_159|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p236_118|Three hours later, the man was free.
p283_431|These guys are looking for business.
p253_355|This is a club on the rise.
p254_063|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p284_293|And it's a goodbye from him.
p283_068|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p275_153|I am just trying to do my job.
p247_386|The pair are very much in love.
p283_377|I said she was very young.
p347_201|We went straight into the bedroom.
p255_332|I'd like to take the plunge.
p253_307|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p283_282|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p283_293|None of the agencies was able to help.
p287_251|I should think so, too.
p229_033|And we have a singer.
p248_270|He is a young man with a new deal.
p281_307|We need to increase the membership.
p256_176|The hotel was now for sale.
p283_254|Our future is in their hands.
p265_217|At the time, he was a living legend.
p232_184|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p236_238|This will secure the future of our industry.
p274_162|We came across the first set of bodies.
p270_446|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p236_100|Our house was very small.
p250_381|It's as wide as a church in here.
p283_051|It also opened a branch in Livingston.
p283_104|That is the important thing.
p286_443|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p283_148|He was a home referee.
p274_419|The second goal was superb.
p283_212|We are not making any comment.
p287_103|That was the first step.
p267_166|It's nice to be nice.
p281_295|We have to be very, very careful.
p267_088|It's for that reason he should resign.
p236_147|We have a clean bill of health.
p261_282|At first I thought I was gone.
p270_071|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p286_336|And he goes with it.
p283_124|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p267_154|As, indeed, they would be.
p229_061|Art is extra.
p271_215|I had decided to quit the show.
p278_199|Last night was a key episode.
p226_231|The track is currently covered in snow.
p253_080|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p254_282|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p245_222|We were a load of rubbish.
p229_301|I thought it was my only chance.
p237_195|I've got good news and bad news for you.
p279_173|Is Saddam a threat?
p275_144|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p257_238|They may yet have the last laugh.
p232_161|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p228_196|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p254_277|It's a way of life.
p229_345|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p256_308|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p266_102|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p229_057|She's a spy !
p229_151|Who would be right?
p285_057|Scotland had great assets.
p272_295|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p257_268|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p279_405|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p229_240|We are so proud.
p250_076|I was as strong as a horse.
p228_207|Ferguson should take note.
p228_107|It is a good day for the coalition.
p229_379|It's a long process.
p232_151|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p241_183|Four policemen were wounded.
p229_075|It works for us.
p237_323|It should be equal.
p229_329|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p277_372|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p341_221|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p335_276|That is highly unfair.
p232_088|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p277_129|She really suffered for her art.
p269_149|We just had a go.
p237_294|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p228_317|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p251_283|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p279_373|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p275_218|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p258_089|She's got to say something.
p229_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p284_387|That's the name of the game, though.
p279_361|Well, the big day has arrived.
p228_047|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p237_041|He did not know his daughter.
p229_168|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p273_120|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p229_292|We have other options.
p255_266|He can do everything.
p285_338|I'm very lucky.
p233_260|I was happily surprised.
p255_125|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p241_116|I'm delighted about that.
p240_192|People will ask about us.
p229_265|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p272_157|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p285_115|It is rubbish.
p254_115|It is normal.
p279_113|I was angry.
p323_338|We work on the same level.
p263_116|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p248_029|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p233_181|They thought they had found a home.
p313_247|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p306_291|It's not even finished.
p265_215|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p286_338|The letters are going out today.
p275_358|It is a memorial.
p229_305|There is no openness.
p330_031|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p257_320|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p279_246|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p232_091|It is a lifeline.
p301_244|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p229_222|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p240_274|He was also married with two children.
p241_200|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p229_173|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p228_289|The home was now under new management.
p323_369|They were behind the wheel.
p255_055|My mother is a widow.
p249_293|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p233_329|He told the court.
p251_108|I came to complete.
p247_388|It benefits the whole family.
p245_101|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p281_042|I am just going to go for it.
p249_140|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p269_147|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p232_341|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p335_180|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p285_272|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p288_365|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p266_076|Today she has been released.
p229_091|We must look forward.
p285_132|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p229_245|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p266_026|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p317_324|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p271_078|Neither it is.
p252_324|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p266_217|Saturday is gone.
p241_373|Talks are progressing.
p330_278|It was fit for royalty.
p279_075|It is like a river running by my home.
p226_154|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p229_212|But we are not immune to the problem.
p233_310|This is the culture change in medicine.
p333_197|I didn't play well last year.
p229_043|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p258_034|I'd like to continue that record.
p241_274|It was a privilege to work for him.
p228_134|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p229_119|It's not fair.
p279_325|She did not attend the courtroom.
p226_051|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p248_081|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p229_105|They were outside the circle.
p275_247|It was a hit.
p245_338|Indeed, it was magical.
p229_357|Tell us about it.
p288_310|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p226_342|Three years ago he would have been.
p282_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p229_338|It has moved on in the last week.
p317_182|Three penalties were given.
p228_165|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p285_267|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p255_075|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p229_044|I was scared.
p251_072|It was chaotic.
p254_212|The FBI could become involved.
p282_289|I was brought up in a mining background.
p241_146|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p228_364|It is a simple equation.
p301_264|It's the same old story.
p241_287|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p255_359|We are looking for perfection.
p261_428|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p229_053|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p272_213|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p233_253|This year I understood.
p229_263|The pensioners did not want to know.
p282_172|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p334_169|Two of the team became ill.
p233_204|It wasn't to be.
p229_326|I am very happy to be here.
p285_307|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p229_083|Someone who cares
p228_291|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p229_171|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p228_034|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p314_267|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p376_338|I drove the ball well.
p256_038|They're just different.
p229_352|Everything was an effort.
p257_208|I am delighted for Simon.
p226_190|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p253_334|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p269_384|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p299_090|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p269_270|They are never here.
p263_281|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p229_072|She died in hospital two hours later.
p241_052|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p256_258|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p254_121|The fire was above the hole.
p229_136|So the European elections are extremely important.
p251_165|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p226_099|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p229_076|I've not thought about it.
p229_378|They play together perfectly.
p257_180|It is minute.
p233_294|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p229_356|It's the last thing on my mind.
p256_305|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p285_187|What has caused the demise of singing?
p260_199|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p255_292|These figures are truly awful.
p254_330|They haven't got a hope.
p229_127|It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
p229_140|They took a risk.
p281_159|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p279_328|Was this element always there?
p228_097|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p279_122|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p229_308|It's just not funny !
p233_240|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p279_026|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p284_064|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p232_374|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p228_148|It is difficult for Ali.
p229_226|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p251_292|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p237_325|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p251_057|What was the main difference?
p229_046|But it took a lot of bottle.
p269_326|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p278_122|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p255_308|It's certainly different.
p304_221|Who would be a referee?
p251_251|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p258_064|That was the easy election.
p249_216|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p277_355|He could make it.
p263_396|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p284_386|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p245_048|We need to chat.
p267_123|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p281_350|He did a good job.
p241_106|I'm not depressed.
p258_026|It's nice to hear.
p229_215|The procedures were not in place.
p238_163|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p229_280|I am an estate agent.
p249_275|People have no choice.
p251_291|We're in shock.
p229_124|I joined a group.
p226_348|Look at the witnesses.
p237_043|That is a break with tradition.
p263_339|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p317_247|I saw it at a ruck.
p229_368|I am a star.
p229_142|What will happen then?
p288_272|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p237_071|Try to save us.
p229_193|We knew nothing about it.
p229_231|We've got the bronze.
p229_082|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p249_105|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p269_211|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p241_198|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p229_391|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p311_342|This is a big club.
p239_064|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p282_036|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p229_164|I knew he was good.
p248_319|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p288_064|We should have known.
p254_151|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p237_095|Until you hit the big games.
p251_132|Government will intervene.
p258_208|He is slightly confused.
p258_350|It is long gone.
p279_354|It's that sort of night.
p240_212|She should not be blamed.
p232_099|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p288_358|We have to move forward.
p248_180|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p249_064|And a film maker was born.
p232_251|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p269_030|I have a theory.
p229_323|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
p333_371|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p269_261|Kirkwood was arrested.
p275_273|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p237_170|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p248_351|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p285_302|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p226_052|It is the whole package.
p258_039|It will come all right.
p245_151|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p232_158|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p255_252|It's only fair.
p254_205|That is an important part of our role.
p303_082|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p245_109|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p240_337|It could have gone either way.
p299_126|There were no casualties.
p305_416|But it is all by design.
p256_195|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p229_172|I will tell you.
p256_103|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p257_039|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p230_069|It is a job creation scheme.
p257_340|It was very formal.
p258_296|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p233_157|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p229_336|The team for the first game could be this one.
p255_134|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p269_267|The warning is timely.
p272_093|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p229_031|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p258_342|I've got no secret.
p266_144|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p287_140|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p272_184|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p229_113|I don't have many friends.
p251_324|You are the glory.
p241_258|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p226_308|This is a war over our home.
p266_147|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p279_166|It is not too late to get on board.
p249_128|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p232_037|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p229_135|It's an amazing landscape !
p265_145|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p260_038|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p254_123|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p288_110|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p228_096|It is an old family habit.
p278_116|Maybe this battle has been.
p236_182|One season, they might do well.
p288_235|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p275_186|It's an idea.
p241_167|The post will be unpaid.
p255_254|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p270_265|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p294_222|She has so much to offer.
p266_266|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p265_153|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p230_029|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p241_120|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p229_358|There is a cup final at stake.
p229_288|I felt like I was a child.
p279_158|These days are long gone.
p264_390|It is the same with Barry.
p264_456|It had been accepted.
p252_320|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
p247_069|Only water is currently allowed.
p264_174|Now he's back on top again.
p280_198|But they had to be paid for.
p364_245|Colin Cameron was excellent.
p264_433|He doesn't need to hit people.
p264_245|I go home only once.
p264_368|We've had some pretty bad times.
p264_276|Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.
p264_261|Walker declined to put a figure on losses.
p264_429|The people are nice, though.
p264_371|Without rules, the elections could not go ahead, he stressed.
p264_438|However, the proposal is not aimed at rugby, but at all sports.
p264_045|We're working on it night and day.
p335_260|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p280_314|He felt too close to head office.
p264_357|Neil knows the score.
p243_210|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p264_280|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p264_156|It gives a commitment.
p264_297|Autumn will be a real challenge.
p233_190|I was totally wrong.
p264_094|What is the wife?
p264_248|They were game, but not very good.
p264_480|The first four teams were all inside the previous record.
p264_391|The experts got it wrong.
p264_316|This is extremely positive news.
p264_473|It's a tough old job to get for your first job.
p301_286|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p264_407|So I moved on.
p264_470|It is an industry failure.
p264_323|Someone should tell them.
p264_110|You can maintain regular contact.
s5_363|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p264_348|It looks at public interest issues.
p264_463|That does not take much training.
p253_060|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p264_216|Henry should go now.
p264_136|However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.
p264_265|Some changes have been achieved at great cost.
p252_143|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
p264_332|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
p264_268|I may play with two players up, maybe not.
p259_159|The two companies were not for sale.
p264_228|He talks too much.
p264_233|It was a great evening.
p250_161|Life is still very tough for them.
p264_324|They really had a go at us.
p264_343|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
p252_033|Just look at his fashion sense.
p264_442|WE all watch the same match.
p264_435|It all came good.
p264_443|We would deal first with the biggest party.
p264_318|I just felt like a dead loss.
p264_296|Perhaps they were right.
p264_422|We have some options there.
p264_465|He enjoyed being with his family.
p264_247|Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.
p243_136|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p264_274|The third has yet to be named.
p264_105|It would be easy to think so.
p264_036|Certainly, we do as well.
p292_278|It has been only average.
p264_449|The festival runs until Tuesday.
p264_381|People could have a post box in the local post office.
p264_299|He had served his time.
p264_300|That was around July, August.
p264_254|For that reason cover should not be given.
p264_260|We had a grand view.
p264_030|Do not give your details to anyone.
p264_129|These people were my friends.
p238_040|I remember that day well.
p264_077|The time has arrived for a review.
p264_450|We are unable to provide support for future issues.
p284_299|I was the sheep.
s5_098|They are a different team at home.
p336_263|You can spend money on housing.
p264_419|We didn't really have to power up.
p264_310|He left pretty quickly.
p264_398|It was an attitude thing.
p264_283|She now lives in London.
s5_400|I saw one man vote five times.
p264_468|He dismissed the action.
p264_251|I hit you there.
p264_279|It would be nice to be involved in another victory.
p264_133|I hope we've reached the bottom now.
p264_393|No, because they look good boys.
s5_155|He said some things which were better left alone.
p264_397|It was either Wednesday or Thursday, he said.
p264_164|The options seem limited.
p264_345|I believe they are dead.
p280_287|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p264_076|The deal was done on Wednesday.
p264_147|She's been shot.
p264_172|I'm taking each day as it comes.
p264_378|John gave up everything to be with me.
p252_330|We want immediate action.
p264_217|Now we have fresh hope.
p292_369|I'm delighted for Andy.
p264_418|The legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.
p264_230|Many changes are positive changes.
p304_222|We have a team to reach the final.
p264_176|No-one wants to talk about death.
p264_342|An opera company needs to have its orchestra.
p264_482|I'd like my TV programmes to be simple, but not too simple.
p343_046|He died the following year.
p264_383|This is too much like Scotland.
p264_086|Because I was a very physical person.
p264_369|That is for white people.
p252_127|It seemed like four hours.
p252_306|We must move on.
p264_495|This is yet another example of double standards from headquarters.
p264_417|A report will be issued by March.
p260_316|Special measures were needed.
p264_372|I took my chance.
p264_366|Five local people were injured.
p264_312|They might surprise themselves.
p264_313|It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.
s5_294|The union has threatened strike action unless these demands are met.
p264_379|He had wanted to play, but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.
p264_103|The referee had been right.
p264_066|She always put the party first.
p268_363|The performance continues to improve.
p264_102|I feel confident about the outcome.
p264_289|You have made your point.
p252_133|Eight others have followed.
p264_451|These days are past.
p334_175|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p264_427|In practice, the economic tests have to be met.
p264_213|It was men against boys.
p249_246|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p264_084|Maybe they will see sense.
p264_180|I've never had a year like this.
p264_385|His third child was born in April.
p264_353|It's clearly a budget.
p264_405|Good records have always been recognised by successful farmers.
p335_091|The proposal was rejected.
p264_409|You took the law into your own hands.
p264_100|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.
p264_065|It is nice to be a woman and a wife.
p264_377|It would have to look for outside funding.
p264_115|That's the bit that's wrong.
p345_225|I can't get away from it.
p264_104|Jack was always going to win this one.
p264_331|He had played very well.
p264_170|No, but my wife is.
p313_285|I would never even consider it.
p264_201|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p264_191|We tried four banks.
p264_328|He did not say that.
p264_186|She runs like her mother.
p264_388|The view is impressive.
p280_042|He does not even trust his own members.
p278_081|That was a great performance by the team.
p264_375|We have a high quality product.
p252_137|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
p264_430|Equipment is also a problem.
p264_466|It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.
p264_221|Britain will be little affected.
p264_075|That is really all.
p264_426|She had black eyes.
p264_178|We just want this session to end.
p264_376|He was always Scottish Labour, or simply Labour.
p264_459|The party had high hopes of taking the seat from Labour.
p264_359|It had been introduced over six years.
p303_228|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p264_458|The technology looks excellent.
p264_181|Neil has worked hard throughout his career.
p264_132|This commitment should be built upon.
p300_299|They finished second and third.
p281_166|The pension levels will remain the same.
p238_102|It's very dangerous for markets.
p264_367|It has helped focus attention on junior golf.
p264_387|Young people will always run away.
p264_205|I saw people on fire.
p264_121|All music goes into me.
p264_483|Your bank may offer you a choice of options.
p264_436|It was a hard fight.
p250_314|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p280_311|He is keen to stay in public service.
p252_186|Art can challenge our value system.
p264_349|The book is closed.
p264_410|But British scientists were not convinced by the findings.
p260_346|This is a big advantage.
p264_412|Financial services also saw a sharp reduction in new business.
p264_355|Her father had died recently.
p264_380|I have been going through a lot of things.
p264_165|It's been my life.
p280_038|He added that her comments were noted.
p264_270|I knew him well.
p264_063|You could very well be.
p264_116|Nothing would now surprise me.
p264_354|Both watched her win yesterday.
p264_177|Once again, he refused.
p273_263|Her body has never been found.
p243_028|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p252_158|He nearly killed my son.
p264_361|It shows we're not much of a rugby country.
p243_027|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p264_474|I've got to win here to be happy.
p252_276|All films open tomorrow
p264_295|She doesn't know the half of it.
p264_224|It was all great training.
p264_118|But I am in practice.
p267_133|It was a piece of art.
p264_399|But it is her picture.
p252_341|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
p264_145|The truth will come out.
p243_097|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p243_377|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p264_400|The tickets are on their way.
p264_404|It was that kind of match.
p264_351|He is fully fit.
p264_050|The Office is a show about nothing, then.
p252_163|Mr Dewar understood that.
p264_155|The second failed completely.
p264_137|This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.
p264_214|Three hit the target.
p264_486|The accident seemed so simple.
p252_111|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
p264_446|The three previous winners also came from Scotland.
p252_275|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
p264_489|That time may never be broken.
p301_309|This fact is supported by audience research.
p264_479|We were given a break.
p264_168|Everything people said about it was true.
p264_298|Many events are down on numbers.
p343_153|Only one got through.
p361_163|That comes at a cost.
p264_223|IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.
p264_162|It is just too tough.
p264_434|A job is a job, after all.
p264_292|It's just an area of water.
p263_175|Eight months later, he was dead.
p264_112|This makes up for it.
p264_408|That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.
p264_053|It was dangerous but vital employment.
p264_415|I've learned a huge amount from Michael.
p264_208|Her experience is certainly limited.
p264_394|His deal is effective for two years, starting in July.
p264_420|He is very fast all right.
p264_287|He followed the Italian route.
p252_223|Brian was last to join.
p264_049|I only signed this morning.
p264_457|The truth was rather different.
p264_307|It's not a marketing scheme.
p264_264|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p264_240|This is a big game for both of us.
p280_206|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p288_144|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p264_269|Others get through it.
p252_174|It was clearly not a battle.
p264_082|It looks that way.
p288_276|It happens from time to time.
p264_350|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
p280_184|We have come a long way since then.
p264_284|It's not a small step.
p264_401|He plays only for himself.
p264_494|That means a ban on French products.
p280_298|It is based on population rather than need.
p264_067|Things have just worked out this way.
p278_053|People come to see the Highlands.
p226_118|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p264_207|Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.
p264_464|Scotland needs this award.
p264_072|Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.
p264_319|Not one person spoke badly.
p264_441|Sir George said every company in the country has this issue at the moment.
p264_188|In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.
p264_444|The company was set up six years ago.
p264_472|We showed some spirit against Newcastle.
p264_088|They're already booked for next year.
p264_033|It felt right for me.
p264_257|We had a right to expect those days were over.
p257_355|It is a large number.
p264_124|The family moved around a lot.
p264_490|We've got good options.
p264_085|We're at home, which is important.
p236_212|They have the cash and the fire power.
p264_101|Two of our crew were killed.
p264_455|They thought he was asking the right questions.
p264_424|Our performance wasn't perfect.
p264_035|This remains the case.
p264_370|Neither had any other career.
p264_073|Confidence is as low as it can get.
p264_277|People realise we have a job to do.
p264_241|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p264_452|The official also said no groups had made any terrorist claims involving the crash.
p313_156|If so, we want to hear from them.
p270_389|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
p264_044|It does not stop here.
p252_043|This operation will change her life.
p264_421|They could change them tomorrow.
p304_206|Their moment had come, or so they said.
p264_275|He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.
p264_428|I have to protect them.
p264_249|I did not vote either way.
p264_029|The local primary is excellent.
p264_069|This is far too high.
s5_348|Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.
p264_070|He has real potential.
p252_129|We beat the Welsh team.
p252_206|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
p264_157|Now it was Britain's turn.
p264_471|Each year they cut them down a bit.
p264_281|He will get his chances.
p323_057|However this weekend it will be different.
p248_160|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p264_302|It changed the very language.
p228_152|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p243_363|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p264_440|That approach has passed its sell by date.
p264_325|They should try to get tickets.
p329_216|We are opening an inquiry.
p264_042|It is a complex deal.
p280_102|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p264_492|New York is my home.
p232_153|I was in daily contact.
p252_331|Our relationship has been very good.
p336_244|I believe in theatre.
p264_185|The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.
p264_329|We are a husband and wife team.
p264_189|They were certainly tough, but totally fair.
p264_259|We were looking for a base.
p264_106|You're quite wrong, he said.
p250_358|We have very limited capacity.
p264_487|Her father wasn't best pleased.
p264_431|We cannot ask for them back.
p264_493|He added that trading data for the new stores would be revealed in due course.
p273_425|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p264_134|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p252_216|The questions came quick and fast.
p264_402|They have quick front players, but so do we.
p243_234|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p264_113|Firm action must be taken.
p264_161|No such meeting took place.
p264_363|The purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.
p264_210|He suffered severe head injuries.
p264_340|In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.
p264_031|I feel I did not have enough time.
p282_295|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p264_089|The savings can be dramatic.
p264_352|That would concern me lot.
p264_286|The institute board will take the decision.
p264_347|We had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.
p264_051|We were leading by two goals.
p264_392|We have done our own tests.
p264_040|I am secure in my owns position.
p252_178|All options are available.
p264_326|The change could come as soon as September.
p264_071|But I had never been in a theatre.
p252_313|It was a total surprise.
p264_256|We have brought the staff back on board.
p264_317|Other teams moved up too.
p264_382|If we get a penalty next week I want to take it.
p264_226|No partners would lose their jobs.
p264_432|The tie isn't over.
p264_126|An announcement is expected within a few months.
p243_220|I was independent but I am not now.
p264_484|That is surely worth a try.
p280_227|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p256_086|I first met him last summer.
p264_462|They're interested only in profits.
s5_172|There is no doubt there's room for us.
p264_469|If they gave me free electricity I still wouldn't support the plans.
p264_266|Everyone wanted him to win.
p264_078|That is very important.
p264_413|Williams said the same.
p243_098|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p264_258|The group's increasing scale will help.
p264_250|We really are a team.
p280_185|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p264_304|I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.
p264_074|I think with my experience I can help the team.
p243_228|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p264_395|We learned two things.
p264_028|We're only taking on a couple just now.
p264_477|The child has denied murder.
p264_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p264_120|It came a bit late.
p264_119|Trading is tough at the moment.
p264_448|Powers looks straight ahead.
p228_115|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p264_386|They want the style of the sound changed a bit.
p252_408|They had to have hospital treatment.
p264_411|They like big name players.
p264_423|This man must be helped to keep his arm.
p264_273|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p264_341|This deal is a great boost for the Borders.
p264_314|Hibs are playing with style now.
p264_358|He could still be President.
p264_143|I told them during their morning break.
p264_107|I was born for this moment.
s5_039|I wish I could see it again.
p264_083|Now comes the hard part.
p264_047|The results, out tomorrow, will focus on the company's strategy.
p264_068|That is not possible.
p264_337|The regional government faces key elections next May.
p376_178|It was an outstanding performance.
p264_339|Time remains to put other candidates forward.
p264_204|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p264_335|It's quite crucial for me.
p238_215|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p250_407|My immune system had been depleted.
p227_025|Meetings will also remain private.
p259_279|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p257_357|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p259_098|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p298_026|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p250_368|We put our bid in last night.
p250_104|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p270_314|Job losses were also announced.
p273_233|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p250_312|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p250_481|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
p278_050|I have learned from him.
p250_173|Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
p269_264|It is also very valuable.
p250_166|The whole industry is a shambles.
p364_168|One-third of the places are already taken.
p261_447|And we might go back.
p250_483|That argument has been won.
p341_214|The budget was too low for that.
p273_054|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p232_405|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p273_417|There is a solution, she believes.
p250_208|We have to be happy with a British and European record.
p250_037|Rugby has an extended run.
p278_398|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
p250_276|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p250_092|That view is held by many others within the industry.
p261_284|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p259_481|The chief constable has retired.
p273_030|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p295_170|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p250_111|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p306_194|I am considered a teenager.
p278_056|She said she was really sorry.
p227_047|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p236_302|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p376_421|That will be best for him.
p250_488|The Israeli military denied the claim.
p250_457|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p274_455|It was like someone had died.
p250_406|Rugby is a hard game.
p250_253|There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
p250_168|The defender made an impressive debut.
p227_388|There is no deal as yet.
p347_413|We are going through difficult times.
p312_184|There was a substantial explosion.
p250_152|We will try to find someone.
p250_252|The most important thing is the game.
p274_432|The trial will open today.
p250_438|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
p250_491|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p272_340|She said they would appeal.
p250_468|It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
p286_327|McNaughton was not so sure.
p248_350|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p236_173|They could not match it.
p268_265|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p250_351|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p274_170|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p250_051|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p250_366|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p259_311|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p250_031|We will not tolerate it.
p286_130|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p250_292|Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
p249_192|Miller was every bit as happy.
p351_318|He had no access to the database.
p250_379|The countryside is in crisis.
p250_128|That's not an assumption that I had made.
p250_167|People were actually not on his side.
p269_321|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p250_142|That is far too high.
p299_187|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p250_274|Messages have to be reinforced.
p287_217|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p326_292|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
s5_378|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p250_490|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
p295_344|But you can go beyond that condition.
p248_208|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p266_154|They have not been named.
p250_439|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p259_410|The team hadn't been picked.
p270_086|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p292_385|Everyone could see the joke.
p250_408|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
p301_266|It was a moment of madness.
p304_219|It isn't a happy memory.
p250_305|Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
p245_262|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p250_346|He has made his base in Spain.
p227_096|No, the equipment is extra.
p297_280|It may have been a cry for help.
p274_443|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p250_397|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p317_332|The effect was almost magical.
p233_247|The salary changes are long overdue.
p326_245|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p273_409|Russell is delighted with them.
p259_440|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p250_475|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
p250_052|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p248_046|No meaningful response was issued.
p247_135|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p273_230|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p259_036|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p250_403|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p250_321|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p230_384|The marshall at the turn was great.
p250_267|We've had several problems over injuries.
p259_057|Let's hope that it does.
p258_222|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p345_331|We will win the argument.
p250_091|We are progressing with a few interested parties.
p250_123|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p250_441|There were a lot of emotions.
p226_306|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p250_412|Neither man has been charged.
p259_270|He was good, but not that good.
p273_109|He thought she was amazing.
p250_440|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
p270_262|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p329_321|It is high time to act.
p259_083|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
p281_188|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
p270_401|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p340_183|We are really good friends.
p250_290|I feel really confident in that department.
p274_094|He is not a dancer.
p255_186|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p241_211|It had all been arranged.
p259_373|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p250_340|There will be good prospects ahead.
p250_311|Stephen will get his first cap.
p250_172|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p278_185|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p250_054|I had trouble with the producers.
p360_266|He was pleased with his display.
p304_095|I am about protecting the state pension.
p286_268|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p253_066|This is the first step.
p274_238|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p250_365|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p286_109|They must be on commission.
p250_089|I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
p274_089|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p250_263|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
p277_416|The people around me were fantastic.
p250_264|He is a reporter for us.
p250_329|The takeover comes as no surprise.
p271_374|It became a national network.
p259_328|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.

p297_186|Some may end up in hospital.
p335_198|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p335_120|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p299_386|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p314_388|You do that because you want to win.
p295_219|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p314_346|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p306_139|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p335_346|We have rebuilt and reformed.
p301_268|Racism has no place in any sport.
p314_221|The text is reduced to bubbles.
p247_241|She was an only child.
p314_092|He said because people had invited him.
p292_194|Only local people are helping.
p238_279|I came up through the ranks.
p305_208|I believe in the Church.
p314_052|The prognosis is excellent.
p314_407|The review has been conducted fairly.
p335_085|He was extremely nervous.
p303_286|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p301_352|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p335_312|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p335_068|I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
p335_251|Who would have thought it?
p301_323|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p307_326|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p335_224|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p292_120|Is my wife a racist?
p314_223|We don't say there was a massacre.
p239_399|Both sides have to step back.
p314_037|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p301_359|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p335_181|Our customers come first.
p335_062|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p301_262|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p271_190|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p301_321|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p230_355|We are encouraged by the news.
p307_345|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p335_031|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
p317_391|This looks like it is anything but open.
p335_192|That wasn't for me.
p335_283|I think it will make a huge difference.
p335_097|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
p300_370|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p301_278|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p335_331|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p335_136|Suddenly, directing was the thing he wanted to do.
p306_061|It's all too short term.
p274_463|It's because they can't understand the language.
p301_329|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p238_249|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p335_282|Arsenal considered the job done.
p314_137|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p294_070|I don't have any answer for them.
p360_072|They couldn't believe what had happened.
p314_239|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
p335_296|I'd never be free.
p335_116|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p335_217|This doesn't have to be our future.
p333_075|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p335_309|Luckily for us, he enjoyed the experience.
p239_034|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p323_166|There are so many people to thank.
p335_257|That gives us a bit of a chance.
p314_260|I am deeply sorry they did.
p292_332|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
p307_295|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p301_403|There was no cohesion.
p301_381|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p335_041|I only half believed it.
p335_108|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p249_236|Broke the birdie record.
p335_373|We were short of athletes.
p335_348|It was certainly intense.
p263_358|Whether this return was too soon.
p301_348|He did not oppose the divorce.
p314_141|This is the high point of my career.
p301_298|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p292_184|We didn't think anything would happen.
p314_154|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
p292_101|I've learned from my mistakes.
p335_242|You cannot allow it to go on.
p307_314|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p335_161|It's been a good year.
p335_363|It was a job he loved.
p292_135|The plane was in flames
p335_274|We can do nothing about that.
p335_078|History is usually written by the victors.
p314_171|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p335_203|That is a brand name.
p314_181|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p335_069|It is a family day out.
p335_037|There were no proposals on the table.
p335_392|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p335_410|Courtenay took over on tour.
p265_274|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p287_322|It is a court case.
p301_256|Wagner was never like this.
p233_257|I watched a game.
p314_320|I am not among its admirers.
p335_336|We will be stronger in Berlin.
p277_276|Dialogue is the key.
p314_163|I'd say we should give it a week.
p335_341|With us, we just want them to respond.
p301_168|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p335_059|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
p285_325|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p335_046|Rangers deserved to beat us.
p314_357|I like what has happened!
p335_279|Or rather he did and he didn't.
p301_354|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p301_349|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p335_350|He refused to discuss his imminent retiral.
p335_252|I think he was surprised.
p335_330|The whole thing would be perfect.
p297_187|I'll tell you honestly.
p314_088|We should do everything at a stroke.
p303_265|I've seen some of the submissions.
p335_338|I put pressure on him.
p335_266|I think we've got the balance right.
p301_356|We are now setting about finding them.
p335_164|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p335_169|Where is the structure?
p335_408|There is no going back.
p335_219|She was a delightful person.
p326_032|There we were on the first tee.
p307_325|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p307_221|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p307_211|But he just carried on anyway.
p314_162|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p335_249|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p335_066|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
p311_078|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p335_268|I have good memories of Glasgow.
p301_358|We must not go down that road.
p234_333|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p335_187|We do things in an appropriate way.
p335_281|Government sources said, It is building up.
p314_331|You have to think not.
p335_288|I just want to change my life.
p314_386|I can't believe what has happened.
p335_038|Who does he think will win?
p298_280|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p335_072|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p307_216|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p301_198|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p307_233|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p307_404|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p335_135|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p301_384|It looks like paradise.
p314_061|I would not want to be young again.
p335_294|He is also a great finisher.
p301_225|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p335_129|A win was a real achievement.
p288_147|They were later discharged from hospital.
p314_210|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p245_164|It is not fair.
p335_102|This would not be my first choice.
p301_338|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p335_337|It is so damaging.
p335_380|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p314_246|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p227_316|This is a big step up.
p335_087|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p317_398|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p335_379|There's no support for it at all.
p254_082|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p335_081|That would be dangerous.
p314_362|It's being very carefully looked at.
p314_366|But let's not get carried away.
p292_229|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
p255_182|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p335_084|They're completely different from each other.
p226_257|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p263_060|Four other charges were dropped.
p335_163|But the price has been very high.
p297_118|It's too big a risk to take.
p297_287|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
p301_294|Do you come from Moscow?
p307_389|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p335_383|There is a job to be done.
p314_183|He is the example for all of us.
p307_050|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p314_216|I looked forward to it.
p314_235|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p314_109|That is nearly four people every day.
p317_030|The council has been open and transparent.
p292_196|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p345_335|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p335_114|The dealer is on notice.
p314_125|But it will backfire.
p314_421|He is not very big, either.
p335_138|This is not presently the case.
p307_260|That's the sort of game you want.
p335_298|A counter reaction was.
p314_282|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p335_043|All the oil companies are talking together.
p335_171|There's still time for that.
p335_230|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p335_386|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p323_386|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
p335_191|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p323_346|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p314_203|We just want to get stuck in now.
p335_233|We are ready for the long haul.
p335_311|Hitches can be expected.
p300_102|Where is the anthrax?
p335_381|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p335_216|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p292_313|This means a great deal to the families.
p345_234|That is not an easy thing.
p307_374|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p335_110|Or was it?
p335_382|Writing has diminished in value.
p335_044|The failings are serious.
p335_140|Don't even bother applying.
p335_193|I am delighted with today's win.
p335_137|I am prepared to help make it happen.
p335_339|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p335_387|It's our worst nightmare.
p314_402|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p335_409|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
p307_201|Well, what do you know?
p314_272|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p301_239|These guys will not lie down.
p307_399|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p376_146|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p335_227|This is wonderful news.
p304_417|I would think they are just behind them.
p314_173|We've got the top three.
p335_132|My duty is to win.
p335_048|On reflection, it is more than that.
p335_025|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p234_125|There was a lot of resentment.
p314_391|Partition is not an option.
p335_064|This must be wrong.
p335_287|Others were even less confident.
p314_245|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p335_349|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
p314_379|There were three boys and two girls.
p303_274|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p335_008|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p292_331|The company's in good shape.
p374_420|It feels like too much.
p314_041|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
p302_120|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p293_350|Famously, though, there was a catch.
p292_238|This is my home town.
p306_136|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p335_289|On occasions he succeeded.
p335_354|It took more than two years.
p292_341|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p335_322|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p307_313|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p301_280|That nation is South Africa.
p335_185|He had come of age.
p335_212|We are not ruling it out.
p335_152|The elections should have no role in this.
p323_337|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p335_070|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p335_160|This is good news for the Western Isles.
p335_250|Alex is a big part of that future.
p335_077|It's just for me.
p313_393|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p307_308|They will have to make changes.
p267_156|Seven people were later detained by police.
p314_354|There is access for disabled people.
p314_028|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p234_294|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p292_293|They are the heroes.
p301_200|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p314_225|The island will never recover.
p292_096|Let's see that increase over the years.
p335_333|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p314_232|The next one comes up.
p335_076|He had a moustache.
p314_358|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p301_324|A friendship that will endure.
p292_199|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p307_245|Which perhaps is just as well.
p236_338|The game is now open.
p335_269|Nothing can bring back their son.
p335_177|Teams are always interesting to watch.
p307_242|There are nine people here now.
p335_205|It is best value.
p301_285|It was an empowering journey.
p307_205|He will emerge as a world leader.
p335_340|I'm the one who has to suffer.
p335_262|Intensive care has been very busy.
p307_254|The final stage is paranoia.
p307_049|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p297_256|However, we had no failures in our side.
p292_320|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p314_191|They had been together for about three years.
p307_252|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p335_390|It's really nothing new.
p301_382|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p335_406|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p335_263|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p314_096|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p274_141|But she was very human.
p301_332|I am not obsessed with sex.
p301_249|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p335_028|Let's not go overboard.
p335_313|The issues are very intense.
p301_255|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p335_089|We still don't know what's happened.
p306_330|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p345_062|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p292_312|Friends of the family have given their support.
p292_186|We were a shambles at the back.
p245_043|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p335_405|You name it, they have it.
p270_177|His team management was protective.
p307_351|He knew it would cost him millions.
p345_194|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p335_280|Scots actors should be so lucky.
p265_126|It is a time bomb.
p285_306|There is no excuse.
p227_383|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p260_342|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p254_163|It has to be now.
p269_144|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p288_275|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p285_093|It was mayhem.
p266_138|I was dead.
p272_218|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p265_147|Well, he should know.
p260_091|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p265_321|It's very good.
p265_226|Wealth is relative.
p265_113|I'm so angry.
p275_042|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p260_225|We were awful.
p256_047|A neighbour said.
p260_114|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p285_097|They tried to deny it.
p228_095|Safety was also an issue.
p265_061|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p285_053|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p275_258|Souter will be back.
p265_086|They are now divorced.
p240_176|They know no other way.
p236_322|I can live with it.
p245_257|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p281_167|They will do their own thing.
p240_194|It is a farce.
p265_315|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p330_065|We have to expand.
p265_253|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p249_207|The service from the other players was super.
p298_053|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p265_050|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p297_254|Who did the recruiting?
p240_205|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p228_258|They are real.
p265_068|The results are tragic.
p251_266|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p265_258|Blood samples were taken.
p266_328|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p232_342|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p260_310|You should be.
p265_085|This one did.
p265_079|It will be tight.
p304_190|I saw the whole thing.
p279_272|That could be in place by next year.
p287_094|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p275_041|Dancing was her life.
p272_177|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p271_415|But we finished the show.
p265_340|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p288_131|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p282_121|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p254_256|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p351_383|He was the architect.
p240_028|Is this accurate?
p254_244|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p287_300|Either team will be hard.
p263_088|A play is a set of actions.
p275_138|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p249_281|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p272_240|There's the mix.
p272_043|Indeed, he does.
p251_327|We are a peaceful people.
p277_131|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p249_194|I put the drawing down.
s5_380|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p277_319|Is that an issue?
p271_070|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p249_183|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p279_247|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p260_261|This is a question of Islam.
p253_046|It's the only thing.
p265_212|I'd never seen a play about me.
p282_030|This is the window.
p259_364|It's too horrible to think.
p265_209|But she was.
p272_156|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p266_100|May not have been at fault?
p266_156|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
p269_243|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p336_164|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p254_344|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p226_084|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p277_042|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p260_328|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p271_079|Is there a new way forward?
p265_055|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p275_180|He deserved the win.
p265_283|So I did.
p269_190|Does this matter?
p261_178|It is not either national standards or local control.
p266_032|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p271_153|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p272_327|Two people were interviewed.
p260_288|We are not going to forget.
p266_170|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p256_248|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p285_217|That has been the easy part.
p245_200|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p275_110|It was the eighties.
p251_304|You've got to have both sides.
p266_116|It's a shame.
p265_310|My view has now completely changed.
p228_338|This is a friendly match?
p271_293|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p240_032|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p246_193|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p285_194|It's a fact.
p232_082|What has changed?
p265_224|Until they came to do it.
p253_191|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p278_107|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p279_298|What has altered?
p271_290|It was a virus.
p271_337|Who will do it?
p288_200|It's all about money, money, money.
p260_254|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p265_162|Blair's response was weak.
p284_135|I don't know the full story.
p253_269|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p323_097|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p226_283|He looked very sharp.
p245_123|Is that it?
p271_130|We work well together.
p284_271|They seem to get away with it.
p277_364|So there, we won.
p251_331|They had a confession.
p232_332|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p253_194|Peace was won.
p261_163|You had to go and see him.
p285_095|It is a love affair.
p270_461|We are now up against it.
p255_309|Is there on his hands?
p246_036|It has failed.
p275_353|It is not like us.
p265_235|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p265_047|It is unique.
p265_223|I can leave at the end of the day.
p253_314|It will work.
p236_256|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p271_354|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p323_273|We have to break that cycle.
p275_147|He realises his mistake.
p267_220|Because they didn't want to know.
p265_111|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p265_049|TODAY it begins.
p282_151|I was stunned.
p279_312|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p275_139|It was very frightened and dirty.
p232_207|I don't want to use it.
p284_104|That's all right then.
p274_309|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p240_102|He takes the job.
p265_337|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p260_078|People must remain vigilant.
p265_236|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p285_231|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p284_140|The idea is simple.
p266_106|She reflects a bit.
p277_216|The report is due out next month.
p266_235|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p279_094|Yet, it worked.
p282_075|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p292_187|It's not before time.
p299_071|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p288_050|I guess I was lucky, though.
p260_076|The party is up for it.
p227_379|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p277_107|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p269_348|It's been hard.
p265_297|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
p285_240|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p265_072|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p243_383|I just felt that I was broken down.
p280_199|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
p243_364|Both players gave so much to the side.
p280_376|It used to be all hard sell.
p243_284|The fans pay for their season tickets.
p280_394|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p243_235|You are not allowed to do that.
p243_074|But two groups refused to sign up.
p238_265|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p243_308|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
p243_188|I didn't miss the big house at all.
p243_369|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p243_126|So I am going in the right direction.
p280_345|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p243_109|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
p243_224|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
p286_223|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p280_209|They are a victim of their own success.
p243_325|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
p280_168|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
p243_348|And that is the bottom line - box office.
s5_030|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p243_288|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
p243_317|He will just go on doing his job.
p243_225|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p280_138|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p243_043|He too started on the subs seats.
p243_309|It happened on average once a week this year.
p243_134|There is no future in rock music.
p280_328|He is not exactly a pretty child.
p280_157|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
p243_030|She brought a lot to my life.
p280_367|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p280_322|We will not simply hit these people.
p243_140|There was only one living room, you see.
p280_190|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
p243_096|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p280_380|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p243_036|Each brand was owned by a different family.
p280_341|Put another way, they just won't do it.
p280_059|We just want this season to end.
s5_315|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
p280_248|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
p280_139|The programme has been made with great care.
p280_143|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p280_372|He really played us into a corner.
p280_282|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
p280_032|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
p243_236|That is the last thing they need.
p243_211|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p243_353|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p280_131|He's got to look after himself now.
p280_051|I'm as fit as I can get.
s5_256|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p243_253|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p280_093|They had the appeal of TV stars.
p280_092|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
p252_090|There is no issue of national security involved here.
s5_351|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
p243_218|A European final must be the millennium target.
p243_222|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p243_155|Time may already have run out for this option.
p280_332|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p243_382|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p243_252|The rise has come too late for some.
p280_081|I do not attempt to answer that.
p280_065|Indeed he has a lot of output.
p323_069|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p243_213|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
p243_347|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p280_181|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p280_279|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
s5_181|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p280_292|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p280_335|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
p243_259|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p243_208|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
p280_040|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p243_232|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p280_207|I want an answer from the British Government.
p227_090|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p243_221|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
p280_069|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
s5_060|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p280_064|It also has a good labour supply.
p243_312|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
p243_229|I want to see as much progress as possible.
p280_120|It is the right package for Scotland.
p243_077|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p268_047|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p280_262|There would be a north and south division.
p243_165|But the game is still wide open.
p243_080|They said our costs were too high.
p280_121|They have no real friends in the region.
p280_071|It turned me against the whole system.
s5_232|I'd rather play well next week than here.
s5_148|That will reduce my chance of selection.
s5_104|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p252_281|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p243_180|I am secure in my own position.
p243_261|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p243_265|His condition was described as serious last night.
p280_267|The board do not own the company.
p280_068|But it was not all bad news.
p280_062|The referee is there to decide these things.
p280_166|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
p280_327|I try to be open to experience.
p280_084|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p280_061|Talks have continued at many different levels.
p233_074|We were under a bit of pressure.
s5_041|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
p243_099|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p280_205|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
s5_269|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
p280_200|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
p280_163|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
p243_034|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p280_280|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
p307_210|They always want to give a performance.
p280_251|However, the figures tell a different story.
s5_227|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
p252_241|That's been the difference between the sides.
p280_395|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
s5_045|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p252_231|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p280_263|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
p280_104|They won't actually make any money from it.
p280_039|She will get through it I'm sure.
p243_238|The children were later able to leave by bus.
p280_249|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p243_216|I am not going to judge them.
p280_137|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p280_260|And they never show the same film as a rival.
p280_387|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
p280_033|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
p243_147|You should feel involved in their lives.
p243_255|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
p280_095|He will be a very hard act to follow.
p243_316|A report on their property is due within days.
p239_208|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p243_132|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p252_207|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p243_055|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
p243_359|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
p280_053|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p243_170|That is a big risk at any price.
p243_144|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p243_060|It was a day she thought she would never see.
p243_037|That was not perfect golf by any means.
p227_228|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p280_088|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p243_167|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
p280_129|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
s5_328|His style was direct and very human.
p280_273|I think I was about four years old.
p243_100|I am delighted to hear this news.
p280_108|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p280_334|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
p280_375|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
p280_388|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p243_176|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p243_164|Surely it can't run for two years.
p263_104|A progress report will be published in October.
p304_144|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p243_156|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p243_079|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p280_333|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p280_356|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p280_370|I have come here to show support for the families.
p280_183|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
p280_189|The story was not made public by this club.
p280_256|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
p243_127|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
s5_297|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p280_029|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
p280_277|I think the shares are good value.
s5_364|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p243_315|If you believe in the blue and white.
p243_072|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p280_291|He would get into any world team.
p280_118|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p280_125|I think there's not much between them.
p252_140|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p243_158|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p280_201|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
p243_169|We had to work very hard for our points.
p280_041|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p243_087|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p243_398|People have a wish to charge twice.
p243_293|They first met during a Step in London.
p280_357|It is the only natural British site on the list.
p243_212|It is going to change the world.
p280_111|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
p280_349|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p243_082|It's been a great evening for us.
p243_186|A great player has to win major championships.
p243_355|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p243_070|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p280_110|Some young girls also came by last night.
s5_127|I am not under any new pressure.
p243_266|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p280_173|If successful, several records will be made.
p252_097|We are already seeing some positive results.
p243_233|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p280_135|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p243_194|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p243_276|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
p243_237|He has worked for several years in the United States.
p243_133|No country has a similar training programme.
p252_264|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p243_362|He's young enough and he must learn.
s5_307|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
p243_390|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
p243_063|There were no details of the other five victims.
p243_230|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p280_146|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p280_274|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
p243_323|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p243_187|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
p280_270|Its primary business channel is the internet.
p280_331|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
p259_202|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p243_154|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p243_350|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p243_344|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
p280_343|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
s5_096|I bought a flat six years ago.
p280_299|He could understand both points of view.
p243_368|It was a goal which came from nothing.
p243_192|I am fighting the force of nature.
p243_191|You are not long home from work.
s5_204|I do not see this so much as failure.
s5_031|It is about control of our economy.
p243_373|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
p243_281|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p280_130|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
p252_056|He was failed by his health authority.
p280_381|This is not a small amount of money.
p280_026|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
p280_272|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p243_231|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p243_268|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
p329_261|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p243_085|No plan for projects are yet in place.
p280_393|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p280_326|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
p280_086|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
s5_290|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p280_283|He may be ready for first team action in March.
p243_145|All eight victims were based in Germany.
p243_177|It's just a different way of life.
p243_239|Jim was down there with his wife.
p243_286|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p247_160|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
s5_354|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p243_204|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
p243_031|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
p243_203|Full details are expected to be released in June.
p243_391|My tax affairs have been totally open.
p280_371|We have been going for three years.
s5_157|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p280_215|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p280_052|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p280_025|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p227_369|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p270_026|They will not be allowed to succeed.
p273_355|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p270_025|He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
p351_411|You need a licence to run a pub.
p259_207|He should emerge as the winner.
p274_364|Italy was just behind the US.
p282_059|My fitness was very poor.
p278_408|That is the ultimate revenge.
p270_251|I might get an injury very easily.
p286_237|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
p278_094|In the end we made too many errors.
p270_304|It would be great to win the title again.
p270_333|It is far too early.
p263_439|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p270_306|Selection is not in my hands at all.
p270_364|The value of the merger is still there.
p297_092|The scientific debate is dead.
p274_447|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p270_428|The woman is basically off her head.
p345_372|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p245_093|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p273_026|It was as if I had been stabbed.
p270_095|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p252_273|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p270_032|We have to find a way to put that right.
p270_442|It deserved to be a winner.
p259_109|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p270_444|It shows the right amount of progress.
p295_128|We will provide immediate access.
p259_193|You know the sort of thing.
p274_029|Not if you know the person.
p279_098|The peace process will be buried!
p247_118|The website has changed the company.
p270_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p263_033|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
p270_163|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
p270_062|We have made a commitment to those people.
p236_122|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p230_034|He really is a lovely man.
p270_263|No production contract is yet in sight.
p273_424|Such an attack is bizarre.
p278_209|I am very realistic about these things.
p334_372|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p274_310|The rescue package is public money.
p274_219|People should make their own decisions.
p273_163|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
p330_406|We will deal with the refugees.
p259_431|It is not over by any means.
p270_289|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
p281_452|They were good years for him.
p238_441|None of this work is guaranteed.
p234_260|They are difficult awards to decide.
p270_388|Last season was very hard for me.
p361_380|That was a real challenge.
p286_120|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p270_437|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p281_410|That was a touch of class.
p270_058|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p270_144|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p270_136|But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
p263_464|We are over the moon.
p297_199|Any error is severely punished.
p270_169|She returned to the theatre.
p278_147|There's always the next century.
p270_073|She declined to give the reasons for the decision.
p270_042|Merger would be entirely logical.
p299_315|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p274_318|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p270_336|Age is not like other forms of discrimination.
p281_115|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
p314_120|That's not fair to the supporters.
p259_438|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p336_264|Ferguson must take the blame.
p294_193|Something happened on that island.
p270_330|This isn't the end of story.
p270_257|I was just getting over the time difference.
p345_338|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p278_395|They have not got anyone.
p270_097|But the battle has only just begun.
p259_412|It sounds like a wish list.
p270_427|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.
p259_073|It was a unanimous decision.
p225_083|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p270_307|His day had started much like any other Sunday.
p270_231|Yet the evidence is plain to see.
p252_060|Must be prepared to use it.
p259_291|He took over our lives.
p273_265|He could see no other bidder.
p278_089|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p249_070|Have a look at our accounts.
s5_184|You were made to feel so welcome.
p259_432|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p336_094|It's hard to see it.
p257_141|I feel very grateful with everything.
p273_333|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
p263_086|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p261_388|He must have seen the movie.
p334_375|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p270_290|It involved the same people.
p270_126|But we could only help a handful of people.
p333_119|We must improve our relations with government.
p270_253|Everything depends on the weather.
p270_213|They are looking at a flotation.
p270_337|The next week is crucial.
p323_093|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p286_039|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p270_397|It has happened for generations.
p360_094|It's nice to be involved.
p270_434|The British government does not want to know.
p270_331|It will set the tone.
p247_115|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p274_340|This is a historic occasion.
p259_222|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
p261_142|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p247_390|Glasgow University declined to comment.
p273_334|Nobody said it was required.
p247_284|These figures are truly terrible.
p297_398|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p274_458|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p270_033|That is the face of fear.
p286_246|This would include the GM food industry.
p230_402|I've never seen a game like it.
p227_164|There is no signature on this document.
p234_265|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p247_417|Shelter also supports the reform.
p261_122|I was on a roll.
p281_438|I didn't get to keep it.
p230_321|It is a road of death.
p270_354|There is a good example in this city.
p273_291|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p259_029|He has the courage of the unaware.
p238_157|The following are the principal provisions.
p279_114|This is a step backwards.
p273_308|The world record is suspicious.
p226_108|That time is not now, however.
p270_151|It is not disputed that the driver was at fault.
p270_374|They knew that I wanted to do something.
p270_256|Labour was too busy to respond.
p225_254|The problem was a social problem.
p270_216|It would appear to be a good time to invest.
p334_177|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p270_326|Survival is not an option.
p270_370|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p340_182|I came here this week to work.
p287_092|This decision is a farce.
p273_408|There was an element of frustration.
p259_350|The pound has also suffered.
p270_198|I know every village and island on the west coast.
p267_316|He has left the company.
p273_325|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p270_074|It is not in my nature.
p279_269|It left me with a sadness.
p236_206|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p270_084|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p274_112|It's not a quick fix.
p263_466|They're just a good retailer.
p270_137|The first half was depressing.
p376_177|This statement has never been withdrawn.
p246_068|Then followed a bout of flu.
p270_334|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p263_068|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p270_070|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p274_391|It runs until the beginning of June.
p239_416|You're not getting any goodwill.
p273_232|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p270_375|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p270_201|In France, the reverse is true.
p259_288|It is probably in the culture.
p270_109|I would be prepared to go anywhere.
p267_143|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p278_182|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p274_027|Drugs are a serious problem.
p297_059|People will see this over time.
p270_456|We expect a rise by the end of the second quarter.
p261_458|Our legal advice is clear.
p230_307|It could well be military.
p259_377|An alternative must be offered.
p271_416|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p270_127|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p347_414|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p247_116|We deserve a significant rise.
p362_112|Of course, it is nonsense.
p270_182|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
p304_350|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p279_066|That's the truth.
p275_360|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p261_077|He is in the queue.
p285_117|We enjoyed it today.
p234_293|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p228_257|Is that a serious question?
p285_385|They deserved the win.
p285_375|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p246_268|We are happy.
p277_206|In each case they were a goal down.
p285_378|You can cope with it.
p285_084|This is the start of our season.
p234_308|The concerns are the same.
p246_142|I was awful.
p237_303|Who can predict?
p285_183|Many innocent people will die.
p254_156|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p311_205|Our message was inclusive.
p279_287|Who will perform?
p277_358|It's now down in black and white.
p284_371|They believed it worked.
p275_077|I will miss him.
p253_026|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p260_265|The system can work.
p285_180|His name was unknown.
p266_289|It was good.
p285_108|Is that right?
p284_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p275_254|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p253_344|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p226_191|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p266_058|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p272_094|It is a blow.
p260_297|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p285_170|He was a crazy man.
p272_320|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p277_402|Emotions were complex.
p253_361|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p287_339|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p260_356|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p284_095|I love the Dome.
p282_220|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p251_078|I was too young.
p246_330|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p277_399|Is that possible?
p230_414|It is the old story.
p269_194|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p246_122|It is not a U-turn.
p266_046|Is a drug dealer?
p232_392|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p275_177|As we worked.
p226_199|We live by the rule of law.
p288_049|I was lost.
p275_387|They are good.
p253_382|It's just outrageous.
p285_271|It was very fast.
p267_061|He was at home with his pals.
p275_393|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p253_239|Our policy is clear.
p271_342|went on sale.
p248_334|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p254_199|Today was first class.
p299_109|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p253_111|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p271_454|It's a miracle.
p271_319|Henman has been warned.
p275_300|It could work.
p279_109|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p275_234|Of course I was tempted.
p272_366|There is no signature.
p277_244|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p228_265|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p277_075|There was an e-mail.
p284_032|There's a story, too.
p285_113|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p272_401|What was the difference between them?
p272_059|Here's a clue.
p266_298|There was a vacuum.
p284_305|They are wrong.
p228_079|I had my suspicions.
p253_309|She is very distinctive.
p275_355|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p285_241|If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
p237_343|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p237_099|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p285_055|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
p228_278|All options are open.
p233_161|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p351_062|My players are special.
p227_076|There may be reasons for it.
p253_179|The goals were good.
p240_221|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p285_288|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p285_328|The outcome is not in doubt.
p287_225|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p230_260|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p275_392|What happened in the summer?
p275_183|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p272_386|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p285_042|Sure, it's funny.
p269_362|I HAVE a dream.
p277_032|He was jailed for five years.
p284_403|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p271_296|No Briton has ever won.
p304_237|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p285_238|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p233_352|Hartley should know.
p285_380|At the last I found a bunker.
p232_324|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p292_316|We are on a four-year mission.
p246_302|She is really magic.
p284_402|But we are a young side.
p275_115|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p285_143|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p285_374|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p284_399|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p247_396|It seems a long time ago.
p275_137|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p288_091|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p271_169|They are not advertised.
p249_172|Tell it like it was?
p251_337|It's not long enough.
p275_209|He knows a lot.
p282_130|No production was achieved.
p285_377|It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
p266_282|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p266_351|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p255_253|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p275_136|It's not true.
p245_126|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p285_304|It needs a team approach.
p285_169|I carried on for him.
p282_131|I am now unemployed.
p275_090|But I was wrong.
p253_385|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p251_335|There was no time scale.
p257_383|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p285_104|It was an interesting thing to do.
p275_080|He is driven.
p241_179|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p302_148|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p302_134|It has been in place since last July.
p308_176|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p295_385|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p341_069|We must put a marker down.
p302_048|What's it got to do with art?
p341_103|People buy everything with cash.
p343_061|He should be a great asset.
p333_147|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p333_227|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p308_075|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p302_167|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p308_096|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p308_110|I hope they understand that.
p347_378|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p333_199|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p302_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.
p347_363|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p302_203|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p334_199|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p374_298|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p333_294|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p302_173|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p308_282|I see no need for change.
p334_174|Do yourselves a favour.
p302_239|They follow him everywhere.
p308_299|I really don't understand what is happening.
p347_112|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p334_029|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p302_191|It's amazing it happened in daytime.
p308_159|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p308_126|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p302_106|But the attachment took a lot of growing.
p333_316|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p308_090|The same goes for personnel.
p308_172|And now he tells us.
p302_220|Appointed general secretary last September.
p333_076|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p374_253|Which means it matters.
p347_114|The days of empty promises are over.
p308_061|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p347_143|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p302_131|I heard some of his remarks.
p266_379|I am a wealthy person.
p333_357|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p334_120|He also received a medal of honour.
p302_037|We used to keep our business rates.
p302_143|Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
p333_293|Debbie Harry was cool.
p257_426|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p374_387|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p333_279|It is a very interesting subject.
p333_378|It's not just for classical music.
p308_160|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p308_085|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p334_025|A judicial review is also being considered.
p308_052|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p374_064|You, the British people, are the boss.
p347_328|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p302_193|Scottish fishermen comended the decision.
p308_249|It means they actually control the programme.
p302_260|I started on a fire a couple of times.
p302_308|The list is too long for this piece.
p302_166|I was doing well at the hustings.
p302_063|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p302_221|They make it look very easy.
p312_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p302_259|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p302_157|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p308_039|All of us do.
p329_212|Three years probation is just a joke.
p308_117|I want to play at the highest level.
p302_135|The European Court is our only option.
p302_253|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p302_289|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p308_227|plays in dark blue.
p347_044|It does make a big difference.
p308_254|We are at a crossroads.
p374_310|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p308_214|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p308_252|We could have got three medals.
p302_092|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p333_318|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p302_315|It's like the Russians.
p347_149|You do have a way out.
p302_181|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p251_085|We have turned the corner.
p308_123|Do not go into government buildings.
p302_183|Smith has not let him down.
p308_027|Each one has its own system.
p347_092|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p302_298|It all seemed so easy.
p302_142|It will be the final push.
p302_270|The outstanding issues are still there.
p308_154|I know you went back this morning.
p308_219|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p334_104|We are not out of touch with politics.
p308_296|I've got a young family.
p308_213|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p374_198|His name is Michael Owen.
p308_262|It's not one for the purists.
p347_401|Why should we even be asked to share?
p334_054|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p308_156|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p259_192|I will have to order its destruction.
p333_369|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p333_095|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p308_144|You were the kidnappers.
p308_164|But they will not be compelled to join.
p308_242|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p308_246|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p308_290|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p308_112|She will also get a pay rise.
p308_257|It didn't take long.
p302_312|However, there was no hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p334_045|And we're not there yet.
p302_032|He's not very big, either.
p308_086|She could easily have been killed.
p333_365|I'm really proud of my young players.
p333_403|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p302_304|The snipers are also out.
p347_070|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p308_218|They could go no further forward.
p302_243|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p347_150|It is simple, really.
p302_210|I was surprised by his response.
p302_062|He said it was the worst possible result.
p308_095|There was an element of jealousy.
p308_141|The whole region is in shock.
p347_243|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p329_192|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p302_088|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p308_280|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p347_229|It is time for a more honest approach.
p302_058|We must improve our relations with the government.
p308_190|There was great support all round the route.
p302_005|She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p302_233|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p308_226|It is a form of physical exercise.
p302_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.
p302_232|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p302_258|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p308_047|They don't take you to mass graves.
p302_082|PR for Westminister is their holy grail.
p308_116|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p347_357|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p308_313|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p347_246|There is only one caveat.
p308_073|That alibi is now gone.
p302_186|They have two children.
p302_199|All the names are familiar to me.
p334_090|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p314_297|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p334_223|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p334_042|I had enough on.
p302_274|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p347_054|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p329_128|The trial is set for February.
p333_202|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p333_351|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p247_440|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p308_038|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p302_104|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p308_127|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p333_333|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p302_107|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p347_256|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p329_184|Or so we have long assumed.
p308_041|It could have been just a quick fix.
p326_296|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p308_133|I was just overwhelmed.
p308_103|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p269_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
p302_202|I've never been limited on drugs.
p308_069|I hope we can put it behind us.
p308_087|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p302_102|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p302_125|We are still getting signals.
p333_379|This must be kept in total perspective.
p302_294|Is something which we just don't do.
p302_209|There is a great potential on this river.
p347_127|It is just part of modern day life.
p302_136|Do you think they would be any better?
p334_071|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p302_300|The frustration was showing.
p269_389|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p308_093|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p302_275|That got me out of jail.
p308_101|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p302_229|It is something that we will put right.
p334_211|My friends were very envious.
p333_077|They had not been handcuffed.
p308_138|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p302_281|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p347_237|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p302_066|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p313_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p308_137|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p347_060|It is a very special city.
p302_074|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p308_310|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p277_428|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p302_059|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p374_102|Two and a half million people have died.
p347_308|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p302_109|Or so it would appear.
p308_089|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p374_295|I had a sense of deja vu.
p302_161|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p308_031|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p308_042|We are looking for volunteers.
p308_285|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p302_291|He is a success story by any standard.
p302_175|It is time to come into the limelight.
p334_127|It's a matter of huge concern.
p302_049|Happily we found it in the library.
p308_265|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p302_272|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p347_239|It ignores the future.
p308_187|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p308_185|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p308_278|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p308_277|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p347_115|Henry was strong and talented.
p333_130|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p287_220|The red card was okay.
p334_218|We are determined to establish the facts.
p302_206|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p308_171|There is no date on this document.
p293_373|But it was to no avail.
p302_081|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p297_117|The singer's condition was not specified.
p302_153|I'm afraid to say anything.
p308_230|Survival is our aim.
p302_301|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p308_204|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p302_147|I could feel the blood on my face.
p333_073|My game is in pretty good shape.
p333_067|I've taken to the hills.
p302_288|They came into collision with Sergio.
p374_059|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p308_050|I know a lot of people who don't.
p347_255|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p239_068|I'm pleased with the horse.
p308_314|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p308_263|She said he showed no remorse.
p374_139|How much of a cop out is that?
p302_149|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p302_128|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p302_146|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p302_244|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p302_279|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p347_107|There was nobody on the roof.
p302_264|I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p347_165|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p302_053|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p240_126|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p269_209|But I am a worried man.
p257_167|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p279_200|I have a cold.
p251_294|Things can change.
p254_272|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p251_135|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p269_165|It is an attitude of mind.
p272_238|There wasn't a goal.
p249_169|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
p254_350|I kept going for her.
p225_052|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p269_043|It was ugly.
p334_206|We'll have to work hard today.
p226_254|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p256_057|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p269_228|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p249_178|The release attracted little attention.
p251_236|It is a gamble.
p288_055|It will take time.
p274_304|There's nothing I can say.
p249_335|I must make that clear.
p249_208|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
p257_263|And Michael was just great.
p263_128|They've got to account for it.
p237_314|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p269_117|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p248_057|Next league matches Celtic.
p305_338|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p277_455|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p257_168|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p254_237|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p257_120|Does this mean.
p246_148|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p249_065|You did not change overnight.
p249_342|He's a genius.
p249_217|This is a good move for me.
p249_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p360_050|It is like a football team.
p275_105|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p249_204|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
p261_175|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p249_317|They wanted the club to make money.
p228_329|The train was on time.
p255_142|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p232_086|She had kept the news from him.
p269_148|He is severe.
p282_215|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p347_251|Everyone can be bought.
p228_223|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p237_255|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p245_080|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p226_304|Our task is to complete the picture.
p241_365|The play is based on a real-life event.
p249_049|I would love to have him home.
p271_062|Jobs could go.
p361_033|It is a case of taking a risk.
p254_100|Now the system is right behind us.
p249_167|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p255_346|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p376_037|My neighbours are horrified.
p240_295|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p228_055|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p249_255|It is very important that we get the balance right.
p245_327|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p249_042|It's a crucial award.
p249_056|It's very odd.
p249_348|He had played well in that central role.
p286_081|It's all going to clear the debt.
p260_290|Painful, but only because it's true.
p232_096|Then came the crunch.
p248_343|It is horrible.
p275_311|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p292_139|However, this idea is never developed.
p317_164|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p287_190|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p241_103|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p249_244|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p279_346|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p288_151|I'm just enjoying every match.
p330_371|That's the law of the land.
p249_141|It's a question of fashion.
p259_302|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p257_324|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p292_130|I had a train to catch.
p226_297|There's a pause.
p247_310|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p269_061|There was a battle there.
p249_298|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p255_155|The weaknesses are few.
p249_130|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
p249_197|It is tough, but possible.
p251_310|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p238_175|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p255_069|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p249_316|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p237_302|He should have won.
p347_307|That is where the club has gone wrong.
p333_049|You can't give in to the vandals.
p347_088|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p347_035|His views are hardly surprising.
p374_158|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p347_135|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p333_144|It was important to win the singles.
p347_184|The firm was down and almost out.
p333_061|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p333_145|That is impressive by any standards.
p313_220|Some of the players have not progressed.
p326_243|It is just completely erased.
p347_374|They were only there for three weeks.
p347_264|Players want to know what is on offer.
p333_206|Before the games it was pretty open.
p333_237|There were two things going on at once.
p314_275|He has lost confidence and weight.
p347_232|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
p347_187|I think we're very different.
p347_198|Our approach will be different.
p347_288|I mean it happens.
p347_185|I was chosen to do this.
p277_060|It had been in place since last July.
p313_053|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p347_324|This is my music.
p347_343|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
p347_385|They didn't find anything.
p347_148|Is the war over?
p347_029|So now this series has had its day.
p333_178|I didn't mean to kill her.
p317_300|This is the start of a new campaign.
p333_329|I am not changing my event.
p347_271|It was a journey into a new life.
p333_038|Too many factors are now working against him.
p347_369|As it happened, it was much more than that.
p333_346|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p333_225|How many cases have there been?
p323_172|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p347_301|I will carry on.
p333_374|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p293_079|All the people thought that we would die.
p347_110|It needs somebody to give way.
p347_362|And we're talking Big Money.
p333_090|It's a true story.
p313_109|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p347_183|This area is perfect for children.
p347_267|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p333_377|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
p333_315|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p347_057|It will come up here.
p241_160|We do not get that impression now.
p347_224|You can never tell.
p347_048|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p347_043|He had a really frustrating time last year.
p347_034|That didn't happen for two reasons.
p347_393|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p333_254|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
p313_204|Election results are expected soon.
p300_223|She didn't tell us anything new.
p374_050|He had reason to be pleased.
p333_383|Is that where we are?
p347_341|I always said No.
p347_285|Working with him is like working with myself.
p261_422|We're delighted about the vote.
p300_119|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p347_123|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p263_397|The thing is to recognise that chance.
p347_161|I never had a childhood.
p292_356|It is time for a new approach.
p333_027|But who shot the president?
p347_347|It has made a difference.
p293_162|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p347_171|British officials said they could not say.
p333_349|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
p376_117|Eleven events are required.
p347_046|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p333_166|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p298_356|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p374_098|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p347_153|But he is not using them.
p347_113|They are all Arabs.
p347_397|It is not a wish list.
p313_064|I learned a lot from that.
p374_187|I know nothing about that.
p313_124|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p298_311|That was moving the goalposts.
p347_409|We can't win a big game.
p347_208|Who can tell?
p284_422|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p333_100|Could they perhaps be related?
p333_081|They wanted to show what they could do.
p347_163|We offered something different.
p347_211|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p347_359|Which he can do.
p303_310|The crowd was awesome.
p347_038|We have nothing to say about that.
p347_040|I'll have to go out and impress.
p313_179|He's got a great chance of making it.
p347_296|Raised the way you want it.
p313_148|A review of the decision is being sought.
p347_228|The damage has been done.
p347_216|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p347_225|But Annika is just amazing.
p307_033|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p305_244|We hope this scheme will change that.
p333_326|It's fantastic to have finally won.
p374_250|The members have clearly spoken.
p347_039|We've tried every other way.
p347_074|I think we will join the single currency.
p347_090|It is a hangover effect.
p347_244|He's in with the furniture.
p347_372|You realise what this means?
p284_418|It is legally binding.
p333_062|The chief constable is right.
p347_080|No-one said anything to me.
p333_281|Arguably, they have already done it.
p227_368|A crucial moment has arrived.
p347_266|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p347_345|Our future was his future.
p347_102|I'm looking forward to that.
p347_284|It's in the eyes.
p308_209|There is great potential on this river.
p347_136|I don't want to come down.
p333_338|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p261_434|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p347_277|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p347_258|I am a little bit tired.
p347_190|Glasgow then took control.
p307_056|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p347_312|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p347_091|This is my life.
p347_325|I haven't won the world title.
p313_231|It was a stunning strike.
p333_177|I never found my rhythm.
p347_108|Clark is back on top form.
p347_383|All of the names are familiar to me.
p292_077|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p313_149|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p347_083|The Hague is too good for him.
p333_317|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p347_353|It's a very special unit.
p333_408|There's nothing for you here.
p376_341|There was no energy behind it.
p347_342|Britain is a peaceful nation.
p347_134|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p333_180|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
p313_057|We might be back next year.
p347_423|I have not come in to take over.
p347_351|So now you know.
p347_095|We gave them the goal.
p333_043|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p347_302|I think it is a great shame.
p347_316|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p292_290|He already had had complaints.
p347_126|We are in the business of selling tickets.
p347_306|And we were right.
p347_226|Our job is to change that.
p347_213|Or some thought that they have.
p266_412|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p347_294|Six months later, they returned to Scotland.
p308_423|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p293_273|It is typical of me.
p333_221|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p347_062|The message is just not getting through.
p347_405|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
p347_026|We still have a long, long way to go.
p313_144|They played it like a cup final.
p292_373|This is a big, big win.
p347_077|One thing is certain.
p267_354|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p347_220|It could not be too high.
p347_142|I felt we needed to bring that in.
p293_201|What's the rush?
p313_096|That's the National Grid.
p323_141|What exactly is your job?
p347_262|I have just got to get back.
p374_032|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p313_138|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p333_233|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p347_052|My parents are exhausted.
p313_211|I suspect that it will.
p347_366|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
p225_067|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p347_118|Faces from the Eighties.
p374_129|You're not going to get hurt.
p292_352|There are moments of silence.
p347_364|I was a little surprised.
p347_390|But there's no eye contact.
p347_236|It is a cause for concern.
p333_337|You encourage them - you can do it.
p347_192|My ambitions are still with football.
p333_051|And does it even matter?
p374_127|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p347_151|I just wasn't very good.
p333_236|It is a big time for me.
p333_158|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p347_344|It is very much a matter for them.
p347_370|It's an internal matter.
p313_099|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p333_243|This is the subway.
p333_391|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p314_336|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p292_382|You have to rely on each other.
p347_061|This is only the start of my season.
p314_420|My thoughts are with their families.
p347_420|I just want to get rid of it.
p347_032|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p347_121|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p333_162|That's been our position all along.
p313_224|There is no margin for error.
p374_054|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p238_118|It's going to be epic.
p317_313|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p293_056|That is our unfinished business.
p347_082|That is in the public domain.
p347_156|They've got a sort of unwritten contract.
p313_143|However, consumers may take a different view.
p347_286|It is just too long since the war.
p347_085|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p299_216|They were both very brave.
p347_371|They should feel ashamed.
p347_278|Raymond was always on the outside.
p333_105|That's why he visited.
p307_418|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p347_265|Well, when did he ever refuse?
p347_354|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p347_055|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p333_308|I think that could work to our advantage.
p347_155|I certainly believe we can do it.
p333_359|They were that poor.
p374_092|It's not right of Labour.
p374_066|We were very much a happy family.
p347_403|I get very excited by that.
p305_206|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p347_406|I believe in God.
p306_163|I took a minibus into town.
p347_037|And look at the leading conductors, he says.
p299_145|This has a number of benefits.
p347_238|That is the key message.
p333_244|Altman has every right to be bitter.
p313_026|It is never an easy game.
p374_239|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p347_160|We have not had a formal request.
p297_348|Surely it can do better than that?
p347_063|It sounded awfully like panic.
p347_222|Do not forget about Monaco.
p347_129|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p376_119|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p333_332|That is as it may be.
p333_292|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p333_258|There are a few changes.
p293_128|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p347_402|It was not a foul.
p351_408|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
p312_076|He was charged with perjury.
p341_332|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p312_268|We're still talking about it.
p295_394|It was visibly on fire.
p351_052|I won't go back.
p312_215|The dangers are very obvious.
p376_296|Promises were not kept.
p312_355|He, too, is killing.
p312_323|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p336_194|Where do you think she is going?
p267_148|There was a definite prejudice.
p312_115|This looks like it's anything but open.
p312_357|It's better to be happy.
p312_108|Then there was her childhood.
p363_312|His remit is specific.
p312_065|All were later allowed home.
p351_376|But what lies ahead?
p312_348|We told them in June.
p312_364|She was just that sort of person.
p312_223|He is a very nice man.
p312_226|Such a city does not exist.
p376_332|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p341_259|Our system is archaic.
p312_372|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p236_376|All would be under threat.
p364_286|She died later on Monday.
p312_122|This latter suggestion is very important.
p299_032|It's easy to see why.
p312_188|I probably would have been a dancer.
p341_330|And huge, indeed, it is.
p312_104|I could not believe it.
p363_410|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p312_140|It's an awful lot of money.
p312_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
p312_342|That was the biggest game of my life.
p341_246|I think however, he was having a fit!
p312_313|And they did just that.
p340_128|There may be some resistance.
p334_262|That, he claimed, was essential.
p312_193|There was no question of him not impressing.
p351_260|I think it was his parents.
p312_338|It's part of your life.
p312_177|They are going to carry it through.
p312_321|I wouldn't say this is normal.
p312_285|Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
p312_039|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
p312_235|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p351_266|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p312_190|We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
p312_069|It is still with Ministers.
p312_159|The world is being invited to visit.
p312_341|This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
p312_398|The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
p351_316|But these things are happening now.
p312_383|They have been for some time now.
p297_318|I am not against a further inquiry.
p293_352|Barry will be able to handle this.
p312_307|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p312_278|The past is history, not destiny.
p312_041|I shouldn't have put up with it.
p312_374|It's such a tragedy.
p312_102|They're just a nonsense.
p312_397|And we all understand that.
p312_094|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p312_399|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
p312_067|I think it's more important to have fun.
p297_216|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p312_153|Where does it come from?
p343_129|If so, they were wrong.
p312_335|The playing is perfectly turned out.
p376_143|It is part and parcel of it.
p312_384|It was only logical to end it.
p312_391|The only safe investment is cash.
p293_181|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
p312_325|This is complete nonsense.
p312_284|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p312_178|It was very, very dejected.
p351_245|Haven't been so lucky since.
p364_158|We want to know about the policy.
p314_259|I thought that all musicians were the same.
p312_073|I am still waiting for a reply.
p351_385|It's a fantastic achievement.
p312_401|We must do well in that.
p376_273|We want to sort it out.
p364_066|He leaves a beat.
p374_236|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
p312_120|We are satisfied that this is the case.
p341_348|The urgency is real.
p341_240|Bill is a mentor.
p297_248|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p312_352|And she's not even in the book!
p293_174|The people here are quite reserved.
p314_348|For me, it was a shattering experience.
p312_377|The referee didn't do his job.
p299_243|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p351_299|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
p312_204|I was on the pitch and everything.
p312_161|I think it's a sensible change.
p364_062|You make the choice.
p312_327|There is still hope.
p312_228|It was no avail.
p312_086|Action must be taken urgently.
p312_030|I've got the poster.
p376_336|It is highly unlikely.
p329_041|He will never walk the streets again.
p312_209|Of course he was right!
p295_259|That's the most important thing for me.
p312_213|You can see their point.
p312_403|No-one has yet been charged.
p312_127|What's wrong with that?
p312_261|It was that bad, that low.
p364_057|Partly, it is his own fault.
p252_102|They had three children.
p312_419|There was no pressure at all.
p312_346|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
p312_044|This is not a monument to the past.
p299_311|We are in a learning curve.
p341_192|Who is he?
p376_314|It is the icing on the cake.
p351_388|He, too, was not satisfied.
p351_243|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p312_051|I was in the zone in the morning.
p351_312|Either system could have prevented the crash.
p376_222|And who would argue with that?
p364_081|That would be a big mistake.
p295_343|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p312_098|He added, The old system has reached its limits.
p312_171|They have got off with murder.
p364_067|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p312_381|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p341_404|Golf has lost a great character.
p312_240|Our commitment is to move forward.
p312_034|Well, you might have a point.
p312_139|It's the same with us.
p312_249|These will finally be corrected by next week.
p376_401|Is it a warning to parents?
p364_058|That's where it all started.
p364_274|We are keen to have him back.
p312_036|Now the show is for public consumption.
p312_131|Frustration is not the word.
p312_371|Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
p364_209|This is perfectly legal.
p341_142|They are still going to be impulsive.
p340_412|And Scotland is no different.
p312_414|The proposals have been taken out of context.
p312_373|He said he needed no more evidence.
p351_384|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p364_028|I love you so very much.
p312_395|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p312_049|Back then it was hard to refuse.
p297_420|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
p341_159|That is in the very nature of farming.
p269_296|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
p312_137|I was blown out of proportion.
p312_072|It showed him the way to drive.
p312_230|He was replaced by John Spencer.
p312_093|They should be swept away.
p317_418|She was extremely rigid.
p376_133|The trust has no magic wand.
p312_057|This is welcome news.
p376_242|We played too deeply.
p312_148|He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.
p364_135|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p351_403|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p299_257|It's one up to the Scots.
p312_144|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p364_237|I am very encouraged by this poll.
p312_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
p341_407|However, the report was incorrect.
p312_194|However, we came through.
p341_329|Soon the whole country will be level.
p364_060|Why has it taken so long?
p312_191|He never asked me for money.
p351_293|It happened again, and again, and again.
p312_260|It has to be long-term commitment.
p293_325|You've gotten all the facts.
p351_372|The police have to act to help them.
p312_405|This is my big break.
p295_309|They told him to go to drama school.
p312_367|And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p312_386|I've no passion for any country.
p376_277|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p312_375|It was a long time coming.
p364_137|Destruction came from within.
p312_081|We didn't take our chances.
p299_199|I'm not afraid of that.
p364_120|Who will take them after that?
p295_249|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p312_306|You can't do one without the other.
p312_202|I believe that the answer is simple.
p312_408|There was someone on the floor.
p299_319|It was chaotic and frightening.
p312_396|Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.
p293_035|There is a lot of heroin about.
p312_288|That was the initial attraction.
p312_255|It lasted longer than we thought.
p312_356|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p312_042|I think so - he seems to be in good health.
p312_392|It's the whole season.
p312_185|He will continue to provide support for them.
p312_112|I believe he could have turned it around.
p312_270|He finished the night in a cell.
p312_169|Who would be out there, singing?
p312_096|The test case is still awaiting action.
p312_078|However, there would be no permanent displays.
p312_242|It's a personal matter.
p317_127|Hear what they have to say.
p226_057|It's the big omission.
p297_244|We just wish they had done so before.
p299_081|You can't keep them separate.
p312_106|The Rangers think they have problems.
p312_151|I fell into it by accident.
p312_264|After all, this is the start of the giving age.
p312_376|Gordon Brown was superb.
p293_065|Let us hope so.
p312_258|The claim was denied by first minister.
p297_410|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p312_026|This was a rationing decision.
p312_388|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p312_027|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p341_268|We don't have the credible evidence.
p351_394|I am so, so, so lucky.
p312_416|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
p312_084|There are many children.
p341_342|We are very nearly there.
p312_286|It is all one-sided.
p295_311|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p312_308|Chris Paterson was outstanding.
p376_149|That never seemed likely.
p312_257|It hasn't happened, but other things have.
p312_079|The goal will come.
p312_101|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p376_236|He was a legend.
p364_247|Stand by for action.
p312_156|It is almost certain to be the last.
p312_417|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
p312_227|It made me determined to get back.
p312_393|We had no choice but to go down.
p363_267|It will be a challenging film.
p351_281|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p360_399|These were the edited highlights.
p312_186|I'm going to see my friend.
p312_053|In fact, it might just be the beginning.
p312_099|We could easily be cut again.
p376_249|I love this tournament.
p364_083|His arrival could be the making of them.
p295_294|You're going to die.
p261_392|This remains the party's policy.
p312_037|That decision is now being appealed.
p293_081|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p312_054|The children are being very brave.
p312_351|It was a horrible thing to happen.
p312_231|Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.
p312_055|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p341_390|Then came the second round.
p312_330|She is a great talent.
p312_315|She has left the island.
p312_062|The rest, of course, is history.
p312_267|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p312_080|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p312_407|There is no easy answer.
p312_083|I've played them all in the Champions League.
p312_043|I think it must be the uniforms.
p299_141|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p312_329|It's all happening at a local level.
p364_110|We could do a lot worse.
p330_167|I was proud of our lads.
p312_292|Trevor has been great.
p312_349|Parents should avoid it.
p312_212|But my daughter has got nothing.
p312_328|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p312_035|It was quite distressing for the crew.
p312_170|A number of people could not speak English.
p312_252|Was it a foul?
p376_279|It was worth the wait.
p312_334|However, she is female, and so.
p312_117|Such is the scene of the tragedy.
p312_134|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p376_223|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p376_202|I've never regretted coming here.
p312_347|Saddam is not threatening this country.
p341_114|He had a heart problem.
p312_199|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p351_296|Were they under-age?
p312_208|She looked very settled.
p341_061|Sex is fun?
p295_228|Not so, it transpires.
p317_397|What's the theme?
p266_310|The plot is minimal.
p312_359|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p312_238|This is a major step forward for carers.
p345_083|What happens next?
p312_192|I was a bit nervous.
p341_245|What makes a house a home?
p312_274|It was a new ball game.
p312_291|A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
p351_415|His first album was a hit.
p312_201|Now there's a thought.
p293_266|He will be advised by me.
p312_272|I don't know what he was shouting.
p364_183|He had a horror.
p312_287|In the end, that was enough to beat England.
p312_358|It's just so sad.
p312_214|Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.
p312_290|He's also thinking long-term.
p312_174|I cannot say anymore.
p312_154|Norman was not doing so bad, either.
p312_163|I'm not sure.
p312_361|It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
p312_250|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p351_238|He is doing the right things.
p351_232|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p312_266|You are a liar.
p341_361|That's an old idea.
p363_402|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p351_279|My only concern is for my children.
p263_291|I was first in the door.
p312_155|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p376_235|I think it can count against you now.
p312_045|I certainly hope not.
p228_120|I don't want to use the term.
p312_158|That says something for his strength of character.
p312_410|He supported the decision to review the decision.
p312_222|The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
p312_269|She would say he was still the best.
p312_218|I played well in my time there.
p293_390|All were within range of Israeli cities.
p312_340|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
p312_152|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p361_158|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p299_380|Do what you have to do.
p364_029|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p312_123|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p312_281|They were totally behind it.
p376_230|They want this research to continue.
p364_179|But he did not rule out further talks.
p312_353|Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
p364_086|I said How much?
p312_237|We must not give in to the bastards.
p312_082|It was all very proper and civilised.
p343_114|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p364_147|I would say so.
p312_182|That's when the story first appeared.
p363_231|They chose the latter.
p240_053|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p376_126|The group will report back in the summer.
p312_276|Previously police had said that schools were safe.
p364_161|It is not illegal.
p312_168|What's it for, after all?
p351_337|It's so much more fun.
p312_066|Will you just put it away?
p312_305|It is good to look back.
p351_370|It is a very big problem.
p312_038|This is really good news for us.
p330_226|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p312_293|It would also take time.
p299_221|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
p351_152|There is nothing they can't do.
p351_190|This is a special place for me.
p304_283|Teachers have been given the offer.
p351_261|That is very important to people.
p304_420|That, though, was then.
p295_174|The driver was unhurt.
p299_053|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p351_110|This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
p351_214|No decision has yet been made.
p351_153|It certainly was a birthday to remember.
p351_222|His was the best performance of the day, after all.
p311_186|There will be no change in government.
p314_123|It is a great shame.
p351_064|The devil is in the detail.
p351_209|It's a very important and beautiful day.
p351_380|I am happy for her.
p351_406|So it's a daily struggle.
p351_231|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p351_229|It was the train coming.
p317_382|I lost a part of me.
p351_087|Things are meant to be.
p351_168|Well, what can you do?
p351_378|They promised to fight the plans.
p351_042|What are the barriers?
p317_309|No other country has ever won this tournament.
p351_056|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p297_379|Everyone has his share of trouble.
p351_265|There he goes again.
p351_395|What is it about this series?
p317_245|I now know that from memory.
p256_221|We will be victorious.
p304_404|We expect a full house on the night.
p351_051|This isn't a gimmick.
p351_075|It was a pretty terrible day.
p351_113|What's the problem?
p376_129|We have been very patient.
p351_119|This time it was out of the blue.
p351_309|Then you see it.
p351_027|I have not seen the term immediate.
p313_171|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p351_186|We are still paying the price for that.
p317_091|We could not compete with Rangers.
p295_135|He added, We have the same desire.
p304_278|It is my fault.
p351_343|I am a doctor.
p351_167|He is very confident at the moment.
p351_095|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p351_070|those who are preparing to give up.
p330_184|This is a dream come true for me.
p304_249|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p351_259|It was like being in prison.
p326_304|It makes a huge difference.
p351_252|Now we are back on top of Europe.
p351_273|All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.
p351_170|They will be seen for years to come.
p351_298|It is a very worrying report.
p236_170|That is not the case.
p305_159|He had worked there for only two days.
p351_160|They might also be parlous.
p351_242|He was embarrassed about what he did.
p351_122|We were not going to take that risk.
p292_065|It's really good, as long as we play well.
p351_155|This was a very tragic accident.
p351_365|I believe she was elected unopposed.
p297_409|My heart is not so sure.
p351_244|The home team also had their moments.
p297_138|It was better than a soap opera.
p351_117|I will be ridiculed.
p351_103|Yes, it was too short a night.
p351_354|The Government has listened.
p351_162|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p233_242|We were extremely poor.
p230_129|This is a successful outcome.
p351_207|Six years is too long.
p305_144|It would have very little impact on them.
p351_332|He also called in at another farm.
p351_302|I would love to see it back there.
p304_332|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p364_049|But it didn't happen.
p351_292|Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
p351_346|Our season is not over.
p351_123|Last night he became one of the hunted.
p294_096|It may not even be possible.
p297_104|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p351_271|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
p351_314|There is good quality.
p351_221|We just want them home.
p297_192|We've never seen so many.
p351_093|Only he's not as young as he looks.
p363_133|Many other areas are coming up.
p317_106|We have got the school holidays on.
p304_294|He met his wife and married in England.
p351_405|But is he?
p351_032|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p333_167|I am very, very happy.
p304_326|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
p351_072|I feel alive and good today.
p351_256|The old manager, he didn't like me.
p295_201|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p376_203|This is the last straw.
p351_202|Ownership was the game.
p351_106|We have no excuses.
p351_026|I don't think they can complain about that.
p351_107|- Really you will !
p234_291|In many ways, that is as important.
p304_355|The truth, of course, is very different.
p351_382|They were just too good for us.
p317_404|It's only tackling congestion.
p351_151|He is walking free.
p317_347|We don't believe anything anymore.
p351_269|There were moments of humour too.
p351_205|It's not a new device.
p295_151|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p351_401|I am very excited about this season.
p351_322|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p351_254|I want to create events.
p351_348|Money is not everything in life.
p351_146|Mr Smith was dismissive.
p351_373|The cause is just.
p351_044|Who are the democrats?
p351_102|That is not true.
p363_354|I am not sure.
p351_219|This is a historic agreement.
p351_423|I'm going to take it further.
p225_303|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p351_142|The other question is why the scaling down?
p282_200|Who will pay for this?
p351_047|We know we can defend it.
p351_251|That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
p351_090|This is already happening.
p351_291|He's had a lot of injury problems.
p351_377|She makes me so happy.
p304_408|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
p300_180|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p351_375|Our message is getting through.
p297_158|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p297_084|It was the crowning point of my career.
p317_263|If only the problems concerned the players.
p351_120|We need to get the right people in.
p351_319|They were not up to the required standard.
p351_037|Both sides will be aware of this.
p269_287|They were too hard.
p317_416|This was not the show for me.
p351_237|That is important for the club.
p351_074|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
p351_295|She thought she was going to die.
p351_104|I didn't deserve to be sent off.
p254_165|I have got a wife to feed.
p351_359|He was, but only just.
p351_050|Instead we were shot in the back.
p351_101|In part that reflected the times.
p351_366|We are not asking for the moon.
p351_094|The matter is under discussion.
p295_405|I am not retiring.
p351_060|They have been very lucky with the ice.
p351_297|You are going to go to jail.
p376_292|There was mystery back then.
p351_124|But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
p351_083|I just wanted to get off the course.
p351_173|Sadly, they don't seem to know.
p363_296|It will make a big difference.
p351_126|In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
p351_246|He is under no illusions.
p299_055|Everything else is second.
p351_139|There has been no delay on government orders.
p351_059|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
p351_061|We are not the first to be affected.
p351_333|But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
p351_349|She kept him on a string.
p304_356|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p351_331|That has not been the case, as we now know.
p351_317|He will be really pleased about this.
p351_417|The plane was shaking.
p351_328|It's my initial background.
p297_235|Some were close to tears.
p351_342|I am proud of my team.
p351_397|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p351_099|They were unable to revive him.
p351_339|It's getting to me.
p305_220|It may be his last for a while, too.
p351_301|It was an ongoing exercise.
p351_196|Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
p363_179|Perhaps it was just as well.
p351_156|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
p351_200|We need to know more about her.
p351_172|He will be greatly missed.
p227_245|It is the voice of the survivors.
p351_116|It's the way we go about it.
p351_400|You find it bizarre?
p351_358|It can be frightening.
p351_325|Seven people were already in custody in France.
p351_149|They will be ready.
p351_154|If you can work, you should work.
p314_364|Now it has become a big picture.
p351_091|We have a rehearsal.
p376_102|Now he is in charge of this.
p376_086|Which is fair enough.
p351_171|I'm really happy with how things went there.
p304_383|I think we're going to make it.
p281_131|She was also very brave.
p351_159|The whole thing in general is moving on.
p351_194|It is crucial to understand this in context.
p304_385|Clubs can only do so much.
p282_177|We are the gateway to justice.
p305_090|His handling raises a wider issue.
p351_067|We can't go home.
p351_030|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
p351_147|It was a discussion paper.
p376_137|I feel it is very irrational.
p304_392|That's the way things are heading.
p351_218|The problem is worse in Scotland.
p351_275|This is not a message from ministers.
p293_311|Four had been brought down.
p376_048|The other is the existence of male colleagues.
p351_288|It is giving out the wrong message.
p351_420|We will be pleased to talk to them.
p351_236|The case was continued.
p351_208|They are not a set of options.
p239_305|They have played their part.
p351_290|We were used to being in control.
p304_240|They also have good neighbours.
p236_203|This youngster is so exciting!
p351_177|It was really frustrating.
p351_320|He also seems to have been around forever.
p230_295|It's got to come from me.
p351_351|There was no basis for their arrest.
p294_392|My mind was made up.
p351_164|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p351_169|It is not the message alone.
p351_134|We can play better than that.
p351_166|It feels that the game is off.
p304_312|The working families tax credit is far better.
p295_180|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p317_077|Will we ever play together again?
p311_195|They seem to turn up for them.
p304_411|But it was money well spent.
p351_189|I am just grateful he is alive.
p351_174|But is that possible?
p351_215|I have had a lovely summer.
p351_145|It's just a fact.
p351_184|The parties have no contact.
p351_144|But it will be sorted out this week.
p351_225|I think it is a scandal.
p351_046|What did you learn in school today?
p351_241|They want to play in the World Cup.
p304_252|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p351_085|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p351_387|Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
p351_033|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p351_396|You read it right.
p351_247|It got no better.
p294_141|He invented the language.
p351_191|This was a great result for us, a big result.
p351_323|Others are expected to do so soon.
p351_080|I don't understand it.
p351_114|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p351_402|It has proved a double whammy.
p351_340|So we talked about that for a bit.
p351_201|I went away to recover fully.
p351_133|That was my mistake.
p351_132|But, still, it wasn't working.
p317_112|That just wasn't good enough.
p351_115|The way forward isn't going to be easy.
p351_338|That's just the kind of thing we have.
p351_040|We are getting people into work.
p295_179|There's nothing new in that argument.
p351_077|Clearly it is very disturbing.
p351_345|It will carry on.
p351_277|I don't take that view.
p376_068|This was an hour before the show.
p376_145|He then did just that.
p351_165|It is not an escape.
p351_329|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p351_140|I think we can overcome it.
p351_286|That was not the norm.
p351_135|My whole family is.
p305_224|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p351_391|All were believed to be adults.
p351_035|We have to win every game.
p351_076|His track record is impressive.
p351_088|One year later, he finally decided to act.
p351_228|I grew up with them.
p376_161|I played well but missed a few chances.
p317_385|But he has strong links to Labour.
p284_388|It's like a car crash.
p271_425|He is to appeal.
p288_052|Sadly, it can't.
p272_116|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p226_324|We are in the end game.
p260_031|I'd just like to play.
p284_296|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p282_339|She is free.
p225_108|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p246_112|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p266_405|I knew the script.
p272_130|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p253_357|Their time has gone.
p287_329|The show is at an end.
p271_235|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p246_126|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p314_140|I would love it.
p363_136|But it's a subtle process.
p340_161|He has to learn.
p260_072|It was magic.
p284_294|The goals will come.
p260_058|There's a danger.
p267_102|Such actions are rarely popular.
p336_299|Relief was beyond belief.
p284_423|It was little else.
p275_044|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p272_183|Our team is just so young.
p246_243|The scene is about this?
p275_276|We are a grandmother.
p277_410|Feel the air, the space.
p272_066|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p284_425|Nato will prevail.
p233_377|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p271_149|Note the date.
p293_342|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p271_126|The people will come.
p271_150|So I got a blood test.
p266_356|Yet he left a few days later.
p260_157|He can do no wrong.
p260_097|I am extremely sad.
p271_287|You feel very helpless.
p271_344|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p284_055|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p275_140|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p277_034|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p252_064|Our people are ready.
p260_067|That was a gold medal for certain.
p277_099|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p279_030|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p277_237|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p269_358|A great deal has been achieved.
p257_381|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p260_273|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p260_234|The whole thing will be great.
p272_048|We will push.
p284_117|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p277_284|Bombing slaughter rejected
p271_098|It is annoying.
p253_366|It was a funny game.
p260_217|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p260_103|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p288_337|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p260_165|Again, we were lucky.
p275_233|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p277_035|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p253_224|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p284_124|I can't even get into the A team.
p269_121|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p282_310|We have got to get the points from this one.
p233_361|They have not done so this season so far.
p284_355|We have big ideas.
p254_398|Eriksson would have approved.
p284_398|It can help.
p284_319|Your father was a good man.
p282_090|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p281_224|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p257_421|It is marvellous.
p253_410|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p298_210|He had taken everything from me.
p284_029|They have no history.
p284_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
p256_312|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p284_412|It might be.
p326_203|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p284_191|They are ready.
p260_349|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p251_222|Work has started.
p260_138|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p311_251|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p362_107|The task is enormous.
p257_154|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p282_360|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p336_392|I was living with my mum.
p330_134|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p298_136|It was to be published next month.
p298_272|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p303_043|This is purely financial.
p330_327|I think we showed that after half time.
p303_219|It has made me feel good.
p298_161|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p303_271|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p303_199|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p303_308|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p303_042|His charisma is all on the course.
p303_205|I'm going with all three.
p330_405|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p303_225|It did my image a lot of good!
p298_250|But first it goes out on TV.
p329_035|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p329_226|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p330_418|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p303_273|It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
p336_065|I let go the telephone and ran.
p329_039|We're still talking with a few people.
p298_155|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p303_060|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p326_137|People tended to stay there for some time.
p303_128|A lot of people were in tears.
s5_069|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p298_213|They should also have the right to vote.
p298_330|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p303_057|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p329_187|What is the truth about the cow?
p303_336|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p298_316|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p298_184|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
p330_280|Who would take it now, after all this?
p330_337|You let a lot of people down.
p298_165|It is quite an eye opener.
p329_183|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p298_164|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p303_198|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p298_138|It could have been a hammering by now.
p298_207|The line-up is a tasty one.
p230_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p303_096|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p303_190|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p303_180|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p330_170|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p298_055|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p303_266|There is no such thing.
p298_229|But there has never been the time, she said.
p303_318|We have grown up in Britain.
p298_262|She may even appear in some more films.
p330_131|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p298_268|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p298_166|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
p329_054|She has a wonderful mind.
p298_068|Some people still think she should be English.
p263_340|She is on a life support machine.
p298_141|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p323_224|We aren't going to play better.
p303_216|People are so negative about the whole business.
p298_146|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p330_053|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p298_027|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p303_220|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p326_106|Our people should be immune.
p303_139|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p334_423|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p303_088|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p298_085|We really need research to help with that.
p329_139|And that was the adults.
p298_221|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p298_345|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p298_069|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p303_299|And he had much need.
p303_206|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p303_048|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p336_119|We just try to make great records.
p336_351|I am not a happy man.
p329_164|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p303_208|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
p303_113|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p303_038|It was a crucial moment.
p303_114|The cold war is over.
p330_120|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p330_383|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p298_102|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p298_032|The feeling is marvellous.
p298_080|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p330_274|All kinds of things occur.
p298_297|That is a job for the Government.
p298_084|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p298_242|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p330_089|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p329_100|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p298_278|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p311_419|I feel very strongly about that.
p303_030|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p293_248|But one shouldn't go by that.
p329_074|They seem to be backing off from that.
p330_179|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p303_093|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p303_226|This Government believes in parental discipline.
p303_104|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p298_239|I think in three dimensions.
p299_383|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p333_117|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p303_260|I believe we have a good chance.
p330_130|What do they pay to join the club?
p298_126|Will they ever reopen?
p330_316|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p329_159|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p298_099|Their vision was not impeded.
p298_259|Do you think you have a shot?
p298_252|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p303_087|There were no passengers on board.
p303_162|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
p298_246|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p303_173|We're all family men with children.
p303_269|After that nothing could save him.
p333_382|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p314_341|She had been sexually assaulted.
p303_238|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p303_119|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p298_334|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p374_124|It is too early to speculate.
p298_328|Who is going to be penalised?
p303_195|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p298_201|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p298_300|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p303_158|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p329_301|That is just a load of baloney.
p330_092|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p303_325|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p329_057|It is the end of an era.
p329_050|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p298_279|I bought a car at auction.
p298_159|The inquiry had been going on for months.
p303_144|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p303_121|They will know they deserve to be there.
p298_348|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
p298_209|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p329_197|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p330_365|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p303_120|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p330_133|We are now in a safe place.
p298_125|I asked why he had come.
p340_248|Can they be serious?
p303_171|It's just that we see different things.
p303_124|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p330_401|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p330_360|It is simple and easy to use.
p330_171|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p330_058|I think they should have more respect.
p298_170|That, in our view, is an important decision.
p303_211|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p330_341|One person was believed to have been hit.
p330_265|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p303_255|We have reacted well to each other.
p330_285|There is precious little middle ground.
p298_281|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p298_133|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p298_342|I get to work with very good people.
p303_254|I learned a lot from her.
p298_185|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p303_306|Some have other commitments.
p298_100|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p298_108|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p298_071|The cause of the crash was unclear.
p303_062|Don't say you have not been warned.
p303_231|I fell in love with ballet.
p303_064|Seven children had lost both parents.
p298_292|I have been coming here for nine years.
p257_424|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p329_169|We couldn't go very fast.
p281_451|We have the location, which is assured.
p303_338|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p303_076|It will be very useful for us.
p293_148|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p336_199|And it's more subversive.
p303_253|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p298_339|Some of his family still live there.
p329_127|There is no smoking gun.
p298_333|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p303_298|I felt the head was very like me.
p336_100|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p336_312|They just would not have run away.
p303_277|Last year, however, was a different story.
p298_167|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
p298_335|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p298_305|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p298_050|I saw them not long after it happened.
p303_270|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p330_403|They had given up on him.
p303_112|Tell you the team he picked?
p329_026|This could be one such case, he declared.
p303_070|Repayment is not part of the game.
p330_072|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p303_111|Only the scale of change differed.
p298_186|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
p298_304|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
p336_060|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p298_243|How can they engage with the work?
p298_156|Equity declined to comment.
p330_085|I did not want any damage to us.
p298_041|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p303_327|They will want to watch a winning team.
p330_281|I felt really good until Friday.
p330_063|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p303_063|That is a mark of what you are.
p298_192|I think we finished fifth.
p303_092|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p303_129|We have great team spirit.
p336_294|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p303_301|This can only help us go forward.
p303_194|We know them as mobile telephones.
p330_262|I played really well on the back nine.
p303_160|They were both delightful to work with.
p303_103|He went to see what he could learn.
p303_296|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p303_321|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p298_052|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p336_108|Most people know that.
p239_466|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p330_255|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p303_313|Rapid revision was required.
p303_116|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p298_337|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p298_346|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p330_103|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p298_196|I don't know exactly what happened.
p298_154|That gives us something to kick against.
p303_319|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p293_147|You can be sure we will have problems.
p303_276|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p298_130|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p298_249|We can just get on with our game.
p329_137|I felt under no pressure today.
p303_083|His parenthood is called into question.
p298_294|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p298_183|Two men have been charged with his murder.
p303_039|We gave everything we had.
p298_051|This guy is never going to give up.
p298_054|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p341_180|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p303_324|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p303_015|The Greeks used it to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p303_106|The luxury has been well used.
p298_143|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p295_388|Things were not easy from the outset.
p303_127|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p298_079|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p298_212|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p303_118|We are losing this war.
p303_177|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p303_131|He loves the big occasions.
p330_066|Others may be trying to catch up.
p303_344|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p269_369|I expected these kind of questions.
p303_289|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p298_320|I am proud of those guys.
p298_247|We're into that build-up now.
p314_371|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p330_279|It is always the same, isn't it?
p298_081|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p298_352|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p298_258|They have a very good method of working.
p303_214|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p303_290|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p303_232|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p330_376|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p298_025|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p303_235|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p298_240|They had four children together.
p330_080|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p239_458|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p278_144|I have always loved the countryside.
p247_170|Nothing was meant by it.
p278_222|His injury was completely random.
p278_054|They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
p252_293|He is a good signing for Rangers.
p278_042|Well, the climate has changed.
p273_171|It shows the strength of the roots.
p247_133|The answer was in space.
p261_219|They have known the hard times.
p278_348|It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p234_165|Anyone can do the sums.
p273_108|I didn't think so either.
p261_097|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p288_348|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p287_227|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p259_158|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p273_279|This is a great opportunity for us.
p278_190|I've always been like that.
p273_377|In due course the deal was done.
p278_316|You have asked for action.
p278_286|I'd like to report a murder.
p261_237|I need a publishing deal!
p259_172|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p247_364|But we welcome this document.
p287_041|This will get their attention.
p234_300|And it was this one.
p236_132|They could use a boost.
p278_112|They almost achieved a draw.
p293_184|It was his job to check.
p278_128|I didn't feel under any pressure.
p304_032|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p278_170|On my day I can beat anyone.
p297_314|And he is immensely loyal.
p361_028|These decisions are not simple.
p286_288|The stage was set for a showdown.
p259_183|It is vital to clarify their role.
p230_305|You have to see it like this.
p278_251|There were no reports of casualties.
p278_059|The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow.
p374_378|It was located on the remote control.
p259_123|We had another last Tuesday.
p278_336|That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
p259_413|The director will be present.
p286_124|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p273_100|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p281_318|That meant the search was unlawful.
p278_079|Mr Smith declined to comment.
p278_159|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p292_223|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p278_162|So was the first half.
p306_032|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p278_153|Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.
p286_333|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
p278_037|It was a hell of a way to lose.
p278_039|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p278_362|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p278_143|Others are not so sure.
p278_119|Ferguson will be a millionaire.
p245_352|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p286_366|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p278_121|The hearing was due to continue today.
p274_302|So the Government will be damaged.
p278_066|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p278_036|Several investments have already been made.
p227_282|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p259_170|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p232_111|He was jailed for a year.
p278_248|A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death.
p278_063|I'm looking to the future.
p263_303|John was there already in spirit.
p295_245|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p360_381|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p278_318|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p259_276|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p278_150|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
p261_092|It was clear on Thursday.
p234_107|Everyone had to play the game.
p278_027|Life was like a timetable.
p278_206|We could soon be in that same position!
p278_057|None has ever been found.
p257_170|My life has been destroyed.
p278_345|The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
p245_350|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p278_096|We created so many chances.
p305_069|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p278_126|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
p278_113|Football is a passion for many.
p259_038|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p273_090|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p278_313|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p278_323|The casting is as perfect.
p278_082|He said a change in legislation was long overdue.
p286_319|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p286_306|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p281_368|The major championships will always have a special place.
p278_108|We have got a race.
p278_125|Which can happen any time.
p278_220|The only problem was the greens.
p278_064|But it has been an amazing experience.
p278_168|US is the only country to vote against resolution.
p238_103|The fans would love it.
p307_271|Bombing is the easy option.
p247_144|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p230_060|It's not covered by the insurance.
p278_401|They know it'll be fantastic.
p286_355|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
p287_259|It is not enough to be first division champions.
p278_065|The judge was really nice.
p345_145|His name has not been released.
p345_089|I believe that so strongly.
p304_384|I didn't know where they were.
p345_368|Anything that was going, really.
p345_037|I was completely knackered.
p300_110|I am prepared to step down.
p236_337|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p345_195|I never want to have any children.
p305_099|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p345_336|I just want to do the good work.
p345_287|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p304_093|But we are losing that connection.
p345_293|Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
p345_291|I don't think we could have expected better.
p292_337|To begin with it looks good.
p234_321|You have to count on other people.
p345_071|I had to lie.
p239_318|The result is utterly compelling.
p345_051|It was time to act.
p268_403|We're looking for unity in the council.
p345_265|That will not change.
p345_164|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p360_373|Or is it?
p287_081|I've never seen anything like it.
p345_279|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p345_081|It was that kind of afternoon.
p345_321|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p261_162|I would probably have to agree with him.
p295_222|My life has been turned upside down.
p345_369|He will take it in his stride.
p226_314|I did not name it.
p314_262|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p345_226|I believe in the Union.
p345_030|The Farmer is called an idiot.
p345_319|Is she in trouble?
p345_035|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p345_140|It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
p345_107|I was going to help with the dinner.
p345_132|The whole matter is done and dusted.
p345_216|And we will do it.
p345_175|We should have gone solo.
p345_082|It is a freedom.
p345_344|We live in shorthand.
p292_066|We would certainly consider the proposals.
p292_183|Progress is being made but it is slow.
p345_181|We don't know what happened.
p345_345|But something has been lost in the translation.
p345_066|That is part of athletics.
p345_365|Her life is now back on track.
p292_049|The racist abuse was terrible.
p292_302|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
p345_079|He would have loved it.
p345_184|That in itself is an erotic experience.
p345_204|Things were so intense in the studio.
p345_034|We had to laugh.
p345_260|What is so unusual about this case?
p271_177|It is really good news.
p297_299|It has not yet opened to pupils.
p345_090|That, though, is an old story.
p345_272|This action could have been avoided.
p345_229|It will be all about the Olympics.
p297_215|This club have been fair to me.
p292_272|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p345_252|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p345_383|Is he going to look after them?
p345_123|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p294_257|I get on him, he gets on me.
p345_144|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p345_283|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p345_059|They were willing us to get a second.
p345_282|We are not going to be complacent.
p292_259|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p345_033|It's a lot of pressure on me.
p292_153|Other forces were, however, at work.
p345_095|He was at it again yesterday.
p345_025|This is a new era.
p345_138|I was on my own.
p345_203|No, it's never been mentioned.
p345_356|We had a good time.
p236_229|Death is outside the language.
p292_201|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p345_099|It has to work.
p345_379|And therein lies the problem.
p230_127|The opposite is the case.
p292_114|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p345_027|All the people here are local.
p345_212|He would have come into the house.
p345_324|But could it afford to run it?
p345_150|See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.
p293_385|It was even worse than at home.
p345_384|They are appealing for witnesses.
p345_274|And they still have the final to come.
p345_289|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p292_246|It starts to get you down.
p345_357|I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.
p345_241|I can't describe it.
p292_255|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p345_149|That's a huge amount.
p297_289|I couldn't put my finger on it.
p345_047|His record with England was not good.
p363_224|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p230_213|All will be revealed in due course.
p345_078|I have nothing to lose.
p345_374|This is bound to happen.
p345_092|They don't work anymore anyway.
p345_142|Scotland has lost a great man.
p345_233|The game was up.
p301_240|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p292_251|I said, What was that about?
p301_333|They've been at it for five hours.
p345_205|The devil, of course, will be in the detail.
p345_189|We've seen that time and time again.
p345_119|I'll just have to live with that.
p345_270|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p345_242|Surely it should be the other way round.
p345_088|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p345_367|By now he was very ill with cancer.
p345_210|But it is looking very positive.
p238_260|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p345_247|No injuries were reported.
p345_235|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p345_054|We will be paying agency rates.
p345_187|It's all too early.
p292_072|He was between people and God.
p345_209|The Lobby is not failing.
p345_308|I can't say anything about any figure.
p345_390|His instructions were clear.
p297_232|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p292_058|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p252_328|We were caught out.
p345_230|They are very frightened.
p293_034|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p281_297|It is a symbolic concert.
p266_296|Spent three months alone at sea.
p345_342|He is already in place.
p345_353|It was a very big win for us.
p345_253|THE waiting game continues.
p323_394|I want to go home.
p345_213|I want to put myself on discussion also.
p345_199|I know my sons.
p345_139|They were part of our own family.
p345_114|Let's get it on.
p345_146|For some, it was more painful than others.
p345_277|It was like the old days.
p345_113|I have been thinking about that this week.
p314_174|I was never alone with her, right?
p263_195|The shooting created panic in the street.
p345_191|It's not only my respect for them.
p345_154|Normally it would be four minutes.
p345_255|I don't think he was being very fair.
p345_366|I said at the time it was wrong.
p253_217|Then another one came.
p345_086|He insisted that his staff were too.
p345_141|I don't have any perspective on it.
p345_262|But this is different.
p345_067|Who would have known.
p345_097|So far this season this approach is working.
p345_370|I don't believe a word of it.
p294_107|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p345_231|We have all been there at some point.
p345_120|Neither of them was badly hurt.
p345_214|It happens in real life.
p345_314|It should not make the same mistake again.
p345_373|The winner will be announced in December.
p345_161|I have a great respect for her.
p345_224|But this is just the start.
p233_133|It's an amazing landscape!
p345_396|There is still a long way to go.
p292_213|We were extremely arrogant.
p274_339|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p345_280|We can build on that.
p345_343|No one would believe him.
p345_040|Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
p237_285|Immediate action must be taken.
p345_249|It is understood he had been stabbed.
p345_121|He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
p345_299|I was a local hero.
p345_157|No, you couldn't make it up.
p288_240|It's too much work.
p345_355|Everything is up for grabs.
p345_217|It's a human tragedy.
p345_044|Who wants to be a Millionaire?
p292_289|This is his first movie.
p345_348|I just know it's a lot.
p345_220|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p292_325|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
p345_127|Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
p345_261|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p345_124|It is sad and frustrating.
p345_201|It was too close to call.
p345_198|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p266_274|That goes back a long way.
p307_401|I won't go back to Holland.
p345_301|It will be extremely difficult for him.
p345_278|But that is about to change.
p345_183|They had seven children.
p345_202|But who is the killer?
p292_111|What are they like?
p345_111|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p345_237|Rangers are my life.
p345_248|It is not surprising, but it is appaling.
p295_147|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p227_155|It was a funny feeling.
p345_399|It was still there last night.
p345_275|Anyone else can apply.
p295_414|How do we get more people in?
p345_186|You have a plan?
p360_131|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p345_039|A killer is also on the loose.
p345_228|But he is not hopeful.
p345_337|I'm very happy tonight.
p345_102|There's something about being cut off.
p345_084|All our futures will already have been decided.
p345_208|Everything has been destroyed.
p345_147|It plainly does not work.
p292_095|They should come clean.
p304_050|His father said, My son was lucky.
p345_043|However, there were some alarming findings.
p345_056|We expect them to deliver for us.
p292_253|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p292_212|I am appalled by this news.
p345_326|I was waiting for that question.
p295_215|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p345_223|Must have been at the bar.
p345_064|There will be no threat to the game.
p345_340|Now it was serious.
p345_156|But the damage had been done.
p345_219|I am going to fight to the end.
p275_290|I could never be cool.
p255_150|It would be a last resort.
p345_153|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p345_038|I'd rather be singing Verdi.
p345_317|It's always a dilemma.
p301_247|He would just say it was terrible.
p292_339|This was a unique election.
p292_252|This could prove a problem.
p345_080|We should be capable of managing it, though.
p345_177|That will be the case.
p345_313|They were not missing much.
p292_197|This is my homeland.
p345_264|It doesn't look good.
p345_281|It could be a danger.
p314_184|There is no way to do this.
p345_364|The Government would be ready, they said.
p345_325|I am very happy with him.
p345_358|This was a good performance.
p297_265|I made a big mistake.
p345_256|You've got to fight to stay up.
p345_050|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p345_315|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p295_236|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p345_351|There was no discussion about it.
p345_098|However, his involvement was instant.
p345_381|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p345_288|My wife is coming over at the weekend.
p292_137|I still think he will win.
p345_060|No casualties were reported.
p238_197|His words were not audible.
p345_360|It is not simple.
p345_269|It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
p345_133|I don't know where that one came from.
p345_108|Would you pay to come and see it?
p345_240|There are two options.
p226_209|Now, it's all right.
p360_336|I am very happy.
p345_294|But they miss the whole point.
p345_391|There is ample evidence.
p345_176|Directing, if you like.
p292_050|What is the new religion?
p345_163|IT takes the biscuit.
p345_284|His body was found in May.
p307_342|He's a joy to follow.
p345_076|But her parents will never see her again.
p345_302|It's a gigantic con.
p292_122|It certainly should not be used too often.
p292_269|It is a very beautiful city.
p345_055|Others said he had gone too far.
p345_389|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p345_386|It is quite simple.
p305_189|The sleeper was six hours late.
p345_305|I didn't know she could do that.
p345_211|Drugs are getting through.
p345_101|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p345_160|And so they have.
p345_172|If only the acting profession was that simple.
p345_221|It's the right thing.
p292_336|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p345_103|This is his personal life.
p345_042|You can see how he made his money.
p345_173|It was like a kick in the belly.
p345_397|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
p345_171|It is a hobby for me.
p292_162|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p345_330|WHO would have thought it?
p345_318|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
p345_165|We don't have a solution to the problem.
p345_375|Suddenly, there was an audience.
p345_116|Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
p345_096|You can't go on forever.
p345_188|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p345_073|Everyone was writing me off.
p345_193|This is a very high price.
p345_118|We just want a fair deal.
p345_159|However, he did not stay there very long.
p345_392|It was a game we had to win.
p299_063|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p345_061|The classes are taking place.
p345_196|Business has never been so bad.
p294_271|I also thought, This is a feature film.
p297_255|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p248_134|Our intentions are real.
p345_168|But it won't be the same.
p304_208|Some examples are presented in detail.
p363_123|Motorists will welcome this.
p317_223|He is at war with his knee.
p304_193|Then they were awarded a penalty.
p336_160|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p304_080|It is bad news for us and England.
p304_375|Only the details have to be sorted out.
p304_047|It is not about changing our image.
p304_180|They've got to decide to do that.
p317_109|We understand the changes in the world.
p304_140|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p304_388|But let's not go down that road.
p304_124|But he admits he is deeply upset.
p304_104|Four people died instantly.
p304_045|I was doing a charity concert.
p304_108|Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
p304_197|But who knows?
p323_060|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p304_189|The cost of war is more than that.
p317_170|It is no place for a poet.
p317_036|It was a policy they were against.
p329_130|It was an ambush.
p293_333|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
p304_412|They would never let him go.
p304_125|We told them in August.
p230_126|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p293_085|There are plenty examples.
p304_038|At half-time you have?
p304_230|That could run into millions.
p304_231|It might not survive the process.
p304_394|He just attracted people.
p279_260|People should not become complacent.
p295_040|Our children are the future of our society.
p253_104|That would be unlawful.
p240_103|They will want to perform well.
p304_133|This is a wonderful honour for me.
p317_246|We need to tighten up.
p374_085|His track record is not promising.
p304_179|The real world is full of competing causes.
p304_238|But they will need to play to score.
p363_026|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p304_143|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p304_169|He asked me how they were doing.
p304_247|I've enjoyed the whole experience.
p304_226|I never agreed with that.
p304_052|She was only doing her job.
p317_120|It's to do with context.
p304_340|They should be looking at his victims.
p304_063|No details were disclosed.
p304_207|I love the moment of being first.
p363_093|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p304_097|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p295_052|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p304_184|An announcement is expected today on their future.
p376_329|But there was a heavy price to pay.
p247_093|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p304_139|But we have to plan for the future.
p304_077|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
p297_087|That's how she wants to remember him.
p304_299|He will feel the pain again.
p304_229|But he insisted that victory was possible.
p304_130|You would be a fool not to listen.
p304_418|We would all have liked to run.
p295_101|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p304_296|It makes no sense.
p304_152|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
p341_237|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p304_374|I wish him well.
p304_121|It's something he works hard at achieving.
p304_181|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
p293_145|The same goes for McKenna.
p304_211|I sincerely hope that will not change.
p304_209|You cannot understand it until you experience it.
p304_051|But they also came with a downside.
p304_167|Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.
p304_195|They will have five minutes to decide.
p329_366|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p304_269|I needed a little man in the crowd.
p304_113|Part of the complex is historic.
p293_391|I do not believe they are.
p304_250|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p304_102|There, you were just a body.
p304_319|The teenager had been missing for six months.
p304_306|He is married, with two children.
p304_115|Justice was not seen today.
p304_132|Have you noticed?
p336_269|I've got three other ideas for the day.
p304_154|This is our Olympics.
p304_076|But, of course, it isn't.
p329_293|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p281_030|They've got their own agenda.
p304_422|I will go out with him any time.
p304_267|I can certainly see much better.
p304_182|These are terrible offences.
p304_354|For next season, we have time to restructure.
p304_053|Are you listening, All Saints?
p336_135|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
p304_151|I'm pleased for him.
p317_110|It is a potential factor.
p304_046|You have to have a sense of humour.
p329_111|They agree to meet.
p263_121|Pupils will be the losers.
p304_149|So what makes it so special?
p317_141|Who honestly expected anything else?
p304_069|We have avoided that at least.
p304_254|And that includes the Barnett formula.
p304_245|We want to learn lessons from that.
p299_296|There were so many characters among them.
p304_103|He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
p256_192|I am totally surprised.
p304_300|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
p329_382|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p364_150|Do not listen to them.
p304_029|I know my job.
p304_062|They don't know how to do it.
p304_040|He is dying from cancer.
p304_066|First is open defiance.
p304_343|There wasn't anything in it.
p304_056|I'm very angry about it.
p304_251|They have the cash to do that.
p304_262|I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
p304_297|What will they called?
p266_165|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p317_166|That is a lot of writing.
p304_213|It was total confusion.
p304_073|Clearly, there will have to be changes.
p304_101|This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
p304_280|That used to be another thing of mine.
p304_106|Jim Wallace has been running the Government.
p304_369|He had no problem with alcohol.
p304_341|There were many positives for this club.
p304_039|The butcher is very good.
p304_147|They were due to have begun today.
p329_162|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p304_131|No other offers apply.
p304_049|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p304_141|This advice was accepted by ministers.
p295_068|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p261_127|He can perform well under pressure.
p363_139|Changes need to be made.
p304_111|We will meet again.
p304_286|I played badly, but it happens.
p251_102|That is no use.
p304_329|The search has been called off.
p304_321|And then we got off the plane.
p329_401|We are now open.
p304_204|We should not worry about other players.
p304_162|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p304_026|Who cares about that?
p363_097|She is still very poorly.
p304_118|How can we ignore it?
p304_236|You can't have it both ways.
p304_258|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p363_183|Public safety is paramount.
p299_111|I have great respect for all my players.
p304_270|It would then be up to the judge.
p304_239|He is a joy to watch.
p360_351|The most important thing was to win today.
p304_157|My goal was very important to the team.
p299_191|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
p304_075|I will wait until later.
p304_391|I don't care to recall it.
p304_345|Things start to talk to each other.
p374_293|You must be ready to play anyone.
p304_243|There is no pressure from anyone now.
p304_170|They would have looked out for each other.
p304_358|This is not a birthday party.
p376_034|There was no disruption to services.
p304_314|It is too early to say.
p304_025|So we will cut their numbers.
p304_065|If you can get away with it, you do it.
p304_122|We are taking the back seat on this.
p304_188|Did you see that?
p329_182|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p304_389|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p304_313|It added to the reverence.
p317_132|I think it is wide open.
p304_233|I'm really excited about the album.
p304_196|I see that any day now.
p363_160|He said it was his greatest work.
p304_183|This is it finally finished.
p304_298|We come here in peace, for peace.
p304_200|This guy is amazing.
p304_234|We were desperate to get the game on.
p304_127|That could be at least five years away.
p304_191|There is a demand for another hospice.
p304_092|It was one he was born to play.
p329_289|I have worked with him on projects.
p304_402|His body was never found.
p304_339|That is why this action has been taken.
p304_098|We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
p304_266|The look on his face was something special.
p304_087|He was determined to write a novel.
p341_227|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p304_128|That is my role.
p304_228|I don't think it is vital.
p304_224|He was correct in everything he did.
p237_202|Our strategy is straightforward.
p304_232|The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.
p363_149|It would have been a very explosive issue.
p329_317|Nelson does not disappoint.
p304_088|So is there anything left to say?
p304_198|He was tough and relentless.
p317_190|It's a drop in the bucket.
p304_293|She says she has grown up.
p234_185|He called for a public inquiry.
p336_099|That statement has never been withdrawn.
p317_191|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
p228_150|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p304_324|We are all ecstatic.
p304_346|I would like to stay with Rangers.
p330_339|The result today is an impasse.
p304_100|Did you get the script?
p304_403|Just get on with your job.
p304_338|It really was my favourite.
p364_134|I love a clever reader.
p304_295|But it could have been written for her.
p304_225|I see no reason for them to be.
p304_335|This has come as a shock to everyone.
p304_112|We are about to have our own Parliament.
p304_352|There is room for me.
p304_307|At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.
p304_309|As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
p330_169|This is not a Scottish problem.
p304_376|They say they feel different.
p230_217|My life is in the ballet.
p304_059|For a moment it was all about her.
p304_409|We are not too surprised.
p329_358|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p304_054|And then came the seventies.
p304_218|That is why it is so lyrical.
p304_126|We are going to have a parade.
p341_247|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p304_037|We have a strong team at the moment.
p376_069|It is the worst of both worlds.
p304_393|Hard it will be.
p304_271|Are we going to stay up?
p304_291|You are not going in blind.
p304_381|She failed to win any of them.
p304_186|Or is it the European approach?
p304_305|I can't say that this is very usual.
p304_048|We are waiting for advice on the film.
p304_265|He has changed the country itself.
p304_337|It is not for me, though.
p304_210|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
p304_117|This is not about revenge.
p238_211|But experts have disputed that statistic.
p304_359|Darren is very, very good.
p261_030|We will look into it.
p304_172|Well it had to be something, that's for sure.
p304_253|He wouldn't have played in all three.
p304_275|It used to be less than five minutes.
p245_066|You need a trademark.
p304_067|You probably have never seen them before.
p304_081|They had failed to explode.
p304_325|I hope he has learned from it.
p363_162|The baby deserves the credit.
p304_281|At the election we will oppose the euro.
p304_055|I guess it is down to focus.
p304_248|He was totally without that form of fear.
p329_196|Nor should there have been.
p295_162|David Trimble has sold out.
p297_308|I can understand why they have gone.
p304_135|It was a takeover.
p304_235|But there is a possible place.
p304_072|That is completely against Islam.
p266_332|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p304_044|Scottish sport was not mentioned.
p304_273|It was a very difficult period.
p297_048|What do we do for an encore?
p304_155|Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
p304_268|We then went to see the headmaster.
p304_348|Thirty people have applied for his job!
p304_109|I can't believe it's all gone.
p304_030|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
p326_157|I felt he was excellent.
p304_061|Trading Places was too obvious.
p304_164|And there is no cause for it.
p304_142|That's a pretty good percentage.
p304_089|My back is feeling really good.
p329_181|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p304_330|The matter will come up again.
p363_147|I doubt it would be genuine.
p304_150|It will be easier for us.
p304_119|It's totally double standards.
p376_035|We talk about effective military action.
p360_389|No, they are not the same thing.
p234_191|It is not in the public interest.
p360_156|No, we were not exactly favourites.
p360_312|You just have to get on with it.
p360_280|The joint bid is still on course.
p360_256|They were all on a mission.
p360_413|This is not the end.
p360_148|It is deeply frustrating.
p360_360|There was no-one of the required standard.
p360_142|Or so it seemed.
p292_334|This country has many challenges.
p360_228|It will be a huge difference.
p360_419|I don't think they are too serious.
p360_224|It just never comes together.
p299_328|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p360_095|It's not a game.
p360_214|It was one of those things.
p360_170|I have a good feeling about this.
p292_092|His presence was very important.
p238_438|We discovered that for ourselves.
p360_423|It's unfair on her.
p360_065|He was pronounced dead at the scene.
p360_346|We are working so hard.
p292_242|His musicals were very much of their time.
p360_059|The incidents are not believed to be linked.
p360_300|Is it all real?
p360_110|They offered to make an investment into it.
p360_400|That is the difference.
p360_043|That has now gone.
p360_136|It is a fantasy.
p247_269|I didn't see the point.
p360_183|You have to wait.
p292_342|I had to win this race.
p360_116|It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
p360_168|It was extremely difficult.
p360_082|We never publicise it.
p360_395|They could have been told in advance.
p360_152|Our time is up.
p292_279|He should be worried about me.
p360_269|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p232_352|The boat was fantastic.
p360_146|Who was being affected?
p360_350|I suppose it is quite exciting really.
p360_415|Now, she will not be running at all.
p360_277|I have no further comment to make.
p360_099|It was the dreaded sentence.
p360_119|I have spoken to head office.
p360_361|That would be very good for Rangers.
p295_243|When he came to see me on Monday.
p360_290|That is the key.
p360_407|And he's not alone.
p360_086|This year the exercise is being repeated.
p360_299|Why have you decided to get married?
p360_401|You will need it.
p360_155|First meeting was next week.
p360_144|That was worth it.
p360_096|Buildings are about people.
p238_387|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p360_112|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p360_181|We are really impressed.
p360_093|That's what makes it interesting.
p360_041|A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
p343_379|The call was ignored.
p360_102|They had been forced to walk.
p360_124|So many people will be affected by this.
p360_151|This has been carried out.
p360_287|We know the fight is going to happen.
p360_049|But we are confident.
p360_275|It disappeared into the cup.
p360_294|We are in it for the long-term.
p360_368|Having done it, he was asked again.
p360_384|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p230_181|He played it like a veteran.
p360_369|I think he will.
p360_227|So it was at Easter Road.
p360_259|It makes me feel difficult.
p360_196|I think that he got the message.
p360_391|Sometimes we find a person.
p360_164|It is a new company for Scotland.
p360_383|Their families are gone.
p360_145|What's it going to be then?
p360_184|I did not see anything to begin with.
p292_125|Britain has never had it so good.
p360_063|But it would say that.
p360_229|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
p360_109|It is looking very special.
p292_218|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p360_417|This was great for our sport.
p360_138|That's the way they are.
p360_054|That will be important.
p360_147|Our players are exhausted.
p292_324|The whole family was in shock.
p360_090|We will continue to provide support for them.
p360_411|What she can't have is the money.
p360_276|They might well be right.
p360_031|There are two problems.
p360_324|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
p360_201|I sincerely hope not.
p360_200|The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
p360_390|In football it is not always the case.
p360_283|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p360_355|Lots of them haven't recovered that far.
p292_081|I can't believe she is dead.
p360_033|It's something which is very important to me.
p360_171|And the results were impressive.
p360_162|I don't know how they do it.
p267_299|He refused to name the survivors.
p360_279|Those were the days.
p360_424|As for Owen, class is permanent.
p297_179|The first time you read a play.
p360_036|I want to deliver a learning society.
p360_207|The baby was dead.
p360_220|I was pleased about that.
p360_175|There is an ongoing problem with this company.
p360_240|And what happens?
p294_352|They are not falling now.
p360_230|The characters are always the first attraction.
p360_048|Is he conscious?
p360_161|I told them they shouldn't say that.
p360_211|We should have no more problems.
p360_270|He is having a nightmare.
p360_340|I'm going to miss it.
p360_263|It can take a long time.
p360_141|That was the theory.
p234_281|I had to be into it.
p360_246|Just one of those things, we suppose.
p360_282|It was important to bring them all together.
p360_177|Was the punishment excessive?
p360_305|I'm really proud of her.
p360_058|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p360_422|They need time to think.
p292_228|Human beings are always the same.
p360_379|It meant a lot to us.
p360_293|I have never been unemployed.
p360_371|I'm working on that one, too.
p360_055|But here it is also very bad.
p360_125|It was all very good stuff.
p360_370|The package is a changing one.
p360_195|I'm not going to blame the band.
p360_303|They were not at the property yesterday.
p297_200|They tend to be female and retired.
p234_292|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p360_172|The next game is today.
p360_295|But it didn't bother me.
p236_295|And that match was played in June.
p360_306|What does this mean?
p360_158|This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
p360_209|Everyone is too upset to comment.
p360_292|I am in a good position.
p292_297|You can't get the experience in Austria.
p360_235|I think he was lost for words.
p360_120|I'm not thinking about anyone else.
p360_274|Neither had the public.
p360_372|Frankly, that's not good enough.
p360_241|It is all very upbeat.
p259_185|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p360_159|I didn't think we deserved to go out.
p360_060|But there is no easy option.
p360_213|An announcement is expected soon.
p360_308|We are not physical at all.
p261_263|It seems a shame to leave it.
p360_206|No-one has used it since then.
p360_105|I am looking forward to it.
p360_327|That was the gimmick.
p360_103|It is harder than you think.
p292_079|It was very full anyway.
p360_085|He became enchanted with the process.
p360_092|It was looking bad.
p360_296|I believe it will happen.
p360_285|These things happen in football but shouldn't.
p360_348|Our position is extremely simple.
p292_274|It won't be their last.
p360_245|We deserved the draw.
p314_105|That would be even more disastrous.
p299_353|I am ready for that.
p225_223|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p360_344|They have brought in the replacement.
p360_037|We are just happy that hasn't happened.
p360_343|That must have had an effect.
p360_091|I've always been very taken by the drink.
p360_260|We couldn't believe it at first.
p360_204|It is dangerous and it is a lie.
p360_174|I was a silly bastard.
p295_150|We opened up and everything was gone.
p360_193|There are some good people in there.
p360_066|Only the bomber was killed.
p360_330|I have no idea.
p360_139|Elections would follow in about two years.
p360_030|That depends on Rangers.
p360_352|Golf is not like that.
p360_387|They're all doing it.
p360_223|We are not conducting the review.
p360_034|For once he was wrong.
p360_035|He would not have to explain.
p360_160|However, we will have to wait and see.
p360_362|It's something he has worked very hard on.
p292_161|It is about the script for me.
p360_311|The meaning is very profound and complex.
p360_186|I certainly do not agree with that.
p360_140|We are trying to be realistic.
p360_250|It is part of his game.
p292_210|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p360_205|We didn't, and it worked for us.
p360_421|There was no happy ending.
p360_242|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p360_334|It will be up to the government.
p360_127|We are under no illusions about this.
p268_291|When she went off it was quite amazing.
p360_249|We have had our debate.
p360_329|He has changed my life forever.
p360_264|I don't intend to do so now.
p292_329|But everywhere the problems are the same.
p360_248|No one was injured.
p297_101|That gives it a spirit.
p360_068|Nor was it a game without its lessons.
p360_028|You have been warned.
p360_042|I have no intention of resigning today.
p360_185|It's their moment of choice.
p360_128|But they are a good team.
p292_250|I have played well the past two days.
p360_100|I have never considered it.
p360_302|I would not descend to that level.
p360_077|I have to hand it to the bank.
p292_349|It was all too little, too late.
p360_247|It's up to the defence team.
p360_117|This is a classic.
p360_111|People were hitting the floor.
p360_157|Conditions were very difficult for the players.
p360_402|There is so much at stake.
p360_309|Have we not been here before?
p360_216|But sometimes it was even worse.
p360_198|Stardom is a funny thing.
p360_075|It's worth it, though.
p301_334|There is no answer to it.
p292_208|We've got better players here.
p360_365|She has never been back.
p360_189|Maintain the highest standards.
p307_398|What other retailer would do this?
p360_273|He is completely committed to us.
p360_182|I try to be clear in the narrative.
p360_317|He is a sort of a mystery figure.
p292_195|We had to work hard for it.
p360_358|That has to be allowed.
p360_197|Here it was very subdued.
p360_331|This plan is all about respect.
p360_180|I could easy do that.
p360_332|I don't think he played his best.
p360_367|They are not going away.
p360_078|The question was simple enough.
p281_225|We're very unhappy about it.
p360_414|And they went on to win the title.
p360_192|But there was no going back.
p252_194|A child is not a product.
p360_074|That took two weeks.
p360_271|That was six years ago.
p360_167|But the action is about to be restarted.
p360_301|He will be missed.
p360_396|And what do we have?
p360_388|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p360_289|Is it on a building site?
p360_353|This is a moment to seize.
p360_045|This will take up to nine months.
p314_192|O Neill has delivered.
p360_040|It's not been a good year.
p360_132|I knew that we needed to get out.
p360_215|I can understand that.
p360_047|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
p360_354|I would not do that.
p360_342|The atmosphere was excellent.
p314_188|It was a disaster of a race.
p360_321|He has yet to receive a reply.
p281_195|And this game is all about belief.
p360_338|But this is nonsense.
p360_325|For me, any manager is good.
p360_333|Pakistan denied the report.
p360_079|The voters rejected us.
p360_025|You can never take a win for granted.
p306_356|No person was charged.
p239_473|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p360_088|They couldn't keep it together.
p360_403|It has great potential.
p360_315|We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.
p360_406|Still, it is a very good result for us.
p360_272|Players have to accept this.
p360_115|It has no place in football.
p360_052|That's a concern to me.
p360_359|He has never let them down.
p360_237|I want to celebrate the World Cup.
p360_097|There is much work to do.
p360_225|The club has never won it.
p360_087|It seems very odd.
p360_234|So what's it all about?
p374_403|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p360_410|I intend to end it on a high.
p376_103|Nothing is going right at the moment.
p360_202|I'm really looking forward to that.
p360_298|He did it well.
p292_069|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
p360_335|That is a tragedy.
p360_409|What's the problem with change?
p360_073|The bombing begins in five minutes.
p360_316|I don't mean in a frightening way.
p360_258|You will gain from that.
p360_129|We have a long way to go.
p360_374|What's the difference?
p360_416|It's not an impression.
p314_412|It is a natural reaction.
p360_199|They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
p360_341|There will be no backing down.
p294_122|Did he just want to be on telly?
p360_222|It's a creative energy.
p360_412|I thought they played well.
p360_252|But it was too late.
p360_318|I have learned a lot.
p360_188|Only one person can claim the credit.
p307_250|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p360_044|Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
p360_349|Where did that finish?
p360_408|What was all that about?
p360_046|And maybe they have.
p360_281|A press conference is about politics.
p252_122|Consumers will also benefit.
p360_076|That perhaps is behind the problem.
p292_338|They are with their father.
p292_142|Now we look forward to it.
p360_310|I've been waiting a long time.
p360_385|I didn't do it.
p360_345|How did it all come about?
p292_314|They said that they stood by their statement.
p360_194|But it won't make a difference.
p360_397|It is a relief.
p360_291|We've been here before.
p297_091|Craig is a major concern for us.
p360_190|What could we do?
p360_154|But other Ministers are not convinced.
p360_363|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p360_218|That's a big reduction.
p360_064|Most of the works are small in scale.
p360_173|Hopefully it will be a good day.
p326_118|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p326_184|I love the Scottish and the Irish people.
p326_120|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p326_329|It had been on the cards.
p326_155|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p300_292|Everyone knew where they were.
p326_385|I have to keep working hard.
p326_073|The Insider opens tomorrow.
p326_161|She wanted to move.
p294_106|The other conditions were not specified.
p326_034|At least two women were among those arrested.
p334_138|Could you put it in writing?
p374_308|It was a foolhardy decision.
p293_155|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
p326_174|We are already under pressure.
p306_267|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p326_259|I'd love to have been on the pitch.
p326_225|Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
p294_078|Subs not used, McGraw.
p326_114|Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
p326_344|The then secretary was not amused.
p294_118|We are the weakest link.
p326_387|Art is still a risky investment.
p326_100|It was set in a cafe.
p329_125|More patience and composure was required.
p330_345|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p326_177|The Scottish management team will settle for that.
p326_247|Scotland were on Saturday.
p294_420|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p326_341|It would be a massive boost for them.
p326_153|It will benefit a lot of people.
p326_279|That is where our future lies.
p306_226|I found a fault and worked at it.
p326_122|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p300_377|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
p326_192|So You Think You Want  to be Victoria?
p326_167|About the bad things that happened to me.
p326_111|Hopefully they will turn out tonight.
p326_320|He is involved in everything.
p305_339|This time, there were no such rewards.
p361_404|The message was clear.
p326_086|I can't believe it.
p326_375|They did not threaten anyone.
p326_221|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p300_347|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p300_345|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p326_149|Our position is clear.
p326_315|We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
p326_029|We have got to attack.
p326_090|There has been a sense of frustration.
p326_208|We're still hopeful of concluding the deal.
p300_230|This is all part of opening the door.
p297_370|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
p326_355|He's on the wrong side.
p326_378|But sometimes it works out all right.
p341_121|We are going to go about our lives.
p326_319|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p326_089|It need not be like that.
p326_236|Seems a sensible compromise.
p295_330|That's always the case, isn't it?
p305_318|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
p326_058|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p326_238|I'm happy with the outcome.
p293_112|There is no musical background in his family.
p326_054|His voice is strong.
p295_258|This is your country.
p300_339|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p326_317|Anyone can take a photo.
p326_363|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
p326_373|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p326_380|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
p362_095|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
p326_127|I've beaten her a few times.
p326_186|He was all blackened.
p300_327|It may also be her last.
p326_047|What on earth is wrong with you?
p326_087|I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.
p326_291|That's my big challenge.
p326_193|This is still a young team, you know.
p326_129|This is not a long-term commitment.
p326_172|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p326_135|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p326_117|Hopefully, everything is for the best.
p326_104|We've all been there at some point.
p300_239|It's just gotten too big.
p300_360|She looked very, very poor.
p297_171|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p311_338|Was it just negligent.
p326_351|Capital gains tax is also being reduced.
p326_314|Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.
p326_099|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p294_167|It had until tomorrow to comply.
p306_344|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p300_233|He will become the sovereign.
p326_327|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p297_209|It's a metaphor for consumption.
p300_375|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
p306_331|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p326_369|Broke down and can't be fixed.
p326_144|I've grown up a bit.
p326_367|We're not travel agents.
p326_246|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p326_323|I don't want to change anything.
p326_298|The observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.
p326_253|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
p326_040|The police believe the man was not injured.
p326_316|It certainly sounded it at times.
p326_278|Which is a shame.
p326_150|Yet it does not lose appeal.
p306_310|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p307_145|It is patently true.
p238_421|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p326_233|You write a play.
p326_227|I was very, very happy.
p255_058|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p300_255|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p326_132|Yet she is one of the lucky ones.
p326_354|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p279_390|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p293_072|You see, my back has gone.
p306_242|They were two different types.
p326_331|He did, and he missed.
p300_362|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
p326_152|Then in came a succession of signings.
p326_158|It's not just a male agenda.
p326_332|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p326_088|We have them in offices all over.
p326_049|His art was not just about emotions.
p326_231|They made it very difficult for us.
p374_322|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p326_198|These people just lost their child.
p326_293|We have to adapt to this level.
p300_305|People can get them if they want.
p294_128|I can't speak for him.
p376_183|I can't see him reversing that.
p326_112|The boys are very confident.
p300_319|I tend not to look back.
p326_105|I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
p326_052|My position on the euro is quite clear.
p326_173|Its first awards will do just that.
p306_287|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p326_151|But what will we put on it?
p326_358|Labour is providing none of these.
p326_321|Family, if you like.
p326_379|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p326_148|It's a difficult one to comment on.
p306_332|He made no big mistakes.
p326_254|My family, health and golf is always a balancing act.
p254_394|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p326_399|So is the rest of British sport.
p300_322|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p326_035|How would it work?
p294_119|We have now no choice.
p326_370|I'm desperate to play in this match.
p326_116|What she will do next?
p306_296|After that he became more romantic.
p326_268|We're very pleased about the verdict.
p326_388|That is difficult to answer.
p306_311|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
p326_180|That was merely their initial problem.
p326_037|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
p326_095|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p326_376|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
p326_163|It's always a rehearsal.
p326_265|But there are some problems.
p326_264|She's now on the back benches.
p326_076|I was shocked and outraged.
p233_378|The mood was defiant.
p300_308|He is a law unto himself.
p326_216|You're going to take away my life.
p326_078|We're still in talks and, hopefully, they will continue.
p306_357|I've only met him three times.
p326_340|Self control is just one instalment.
p306_340|Well, was it?
p300_303|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p253_352|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p362_153|A century on, little has changed.
p326_166|There is no internal damage.
p326_080|It was extremely cold.
p326_031|United were in control without always being dominant.
p294_087|They have to work so hard.
p306_244|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p300_277|Tourism continues to struggle.
p326_079|I am immensely proud of them.
p329_156|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p326_169|It was a great team effort.
p306_328|Maybe it helps us.
p326_019|Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p326_256|My game just seems to keep on improving.
p326_025|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p326_195|The British government said she was coming home.
p295_271|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p326_189|The fund has three elements.
p326_382|You feel the pride.
p306_236|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p326_068|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p300_224|There is nothing like this back home.
p306_285|I need them to set my career.
p326_142|I'm the one that said it.
p326_267|It should not lose out in any way.
p326_362|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
p326_191|I feel really good.
p326_306|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p326_398|Then he did it twice.
p326_096|We are very very proud of Alain.
p300_271|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
p376_387|That was enough for the committee.
p326_101|It certainly gives you hope.
p326_342|You never had it so good.
p300_263|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p362_100|There's a strong involvement.
p326_060|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p300_268|Once they go away they won't come back.
p330_368|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p326_228|No-one should see that.
p326_130|It's about attitudes to change.
p306_276|The threat to rural areas is real.
p297_128|It was my shortest audition.
p326_128|His father and mother are in film production.
p326_357|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p326_123|That is a data management problem.
p298_399|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p326_391|My father had been unwell for many years.
p326_272|Three bystanders were killed.
p326_301|English is the language of pop music.
p326_178|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
p294_145|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p300_253|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p326_165|We all have to look in the mirror.
p326_043|I read about it in the newspapers.
p313_412|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p239_321|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p257_235|My future is in the marathon.
p326_257|We would expect it to disappear in time.
p326_124|Nor is he allowed out without permission.
p326_133|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p294_054|What is the point of jailing him?
p326_381|Therein lies the problem.
p287_256|He was on a horse.
p374_100|I want to be there by right.
p326_160|I think we believed the tie was won.
p326_168|She is a very lucky young lady.
p326_042|We just love to chat.
p326_143|It's not hard to get involved.
p293_296|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p326_082|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
p326_182|It would be really interesting if they did.
p300_384|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
p326_307|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p326_194|It's just the workings of the Scottish media.
p326_041|It would be a miracle.
p326_263|I ran to get out of the way.
p329_210|What did they think of her voice?
p300_324|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p300_225|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p326_030|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
p362_154|Wrong decisions Address in full
p295_289|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p326_162|How do you find the youngsters?
p306_318|Too often it is not.
p326_212|His style is suited to Scottish football.
p306_341|We won't let you down.
p294_077|It will not be a long campaign.
p294_086|We have to focus on what is important.
p326_056|But they add up.
p330_159|I'm really looking forward to it.
p306_283|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p300_218|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p326_260|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p326_046|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p300_293|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p306_266|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p326_343|Both are national treasures.
p326_062|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p326_204|Was this a new event?
p326_313|They should use it on the catwalk.
p326_190|You've just got to move on.
p326_027|She is an angel.
p326_146|It changed my life.
p306_238|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p326_368|It's hard not to.
p326_179|He didn't have long to wait.
p326_197|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
p300_317|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p326_232|Well, there is a bed.
p306_323|I didn't know what he was capable of.
p361_408|It is believed he had been stabbed.
p326_048|We will continue to pressure the Government.
p326_108|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p326_103|Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
p306_262|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p326_250|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p326_377|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p326_294|So what is it with Nato?
p326_094|That'd be good for the whole city.
p300_246|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p326_277|It will not be today, though.
p228_122|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p228_048|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
p240_063|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p256_151|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p254_341|It is not like working for a living.
p279_297|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p279_160|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p266_056|They're appalled by that.
p228_138|We had a reunion last week.
p240_343|It is a sign of hope.
p228_133|This plan is an agenda for action.
p266_374|But I managed.
p228_260|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p263_220|They are in the euro.
p255_258|I can't get a job.
p228_121|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p245_306|We have waited a long time for this.
p228_320|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p300_272|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p256_313|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p228_239|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p228_213|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
p279_048|It is urgent.
p292_170|That will be vital.
p245_343|It was forced to divert.
p257_351|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p228_274|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p277_200|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p279_332|It is so unfair.
p279_248|He's a lovely young man.
p228_189|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
p226_046|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p248_261|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p237_110|Further protests are likely.
p228_119|It's in his blood.
p226_327|We do the same.
p240_137|He was in a great deal of pain.
p228_240|She was well balanced.
p232_145|We want to see the maximum of change.
p228_348|Everyone was in tears.
s5_230|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p256_244|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p232_048|But it might have done.
p240_170|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p286_297|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p228_199|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p228_036|The problem is the pitch.
p228_185|I took the gun.
p251_046|That should do it.
p279_275|The script was funny.
p271_270|You take a risk.
p279_125|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p228_268|I was rubbish.
p226_184|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p228_193|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p257_350|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p275_129|Who will attend?
p275_079|He had suffered a heart attack.
p282_302|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p275_205|Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.
p275_068|Strathclyde police had appealed for witnesses.
p246_174|Tony had arrived.
p277_288|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p275_363|He's been in a nursing home for two years.
p246_138|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
p233_386|That set the tone.
p282_173|In a way he was.
p275_428|And they replied.
p275_335|He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
p275_351|Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p275_224|It's the Tate.
p272_404|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p277_427|I know the worry over Iraq.
p275_427|He deserved a red card.
p248_164|I was in the train station overnight.
p275_386|I love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
p282_155|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p275_009|There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p275_226|I will win.
p275_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
p236_442|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p271_274|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p277_451|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p271_384|It's a real problem.
p277_430|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p275_261|It will be done in stages.
p275_339|Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
p275_124|I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
p275_287|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p275_429|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p275_103|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
p282_322|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p306_095|The mood is upbeat.
p340_322|I am extremely cautious.
p236_031|He was jailed for four years.
p240_150|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
p281_038|It is a financial matter.
p277_259|It's very nice.
p275_419|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p275_426|I want a career.
p275_169|We've all had the shots.
p275_303|The court had a number of empty seats.
p282_025|But it failed.
p275_312|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p277_329|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p230_202|Tommy is not a problem.
p272_390|It's like a basketball.
p253_388|I'm glad I came.
p246_026|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p271_403|It is an absolute nonsense.
p263_412|It looked like a river.
p275_263|That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
p271_067|It's good news and long overdue.
p275_425|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p266_420|Paris is not only young.
p292_416|A venue was found.
p308_401|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p334_241|It had won an investors in people award.
p225_062|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p334_214|The approval system will be changed.
p261_241|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p334_274|You can't go back and change things.
p334_335|They've not let anyone into the loop.
p297_058|You just have to accept.
p334_050|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p334_147|It was so physical.
p308_345|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p334_235|It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
p334_156|He was not deterred.
p317_134|We took the chances when they came.
p334_121|It's not one for the purist.
p313_380|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p334_321|I welcome this new service.
p334_213|The house was full of smoke.
p307_312|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p334_391|Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
p269_220|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p334_227|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p334_140|We all thought we were going to die.
p343_221|Here we have not had one hour.
p334_254|Check that he is dead.
p255_239|It's the same as Glasgow.
p333_211|They must be kept on the ground.
p305_265|Our offer will remain on the table.
p334_373|Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
p323_259|He said to me, Which one, son?
p297_039|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
p334_342|I knew he was dying.
p308_354|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p334_311|The whole nation will be delighted.
p334_057|It could take three days.
p334_406|This seems like a very good idea.
p374_318|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p313_258|Or so everyone believed.
p334_145|They deserve a lot of credit.
p334_355|We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.
p334_153|Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
p334_305|He is a Satan.
p308_352|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p313_262|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p334_193|It is in our own hands.
p334_094|Libya is an easy target.
p334_119|We tend to come good at the end.
p334_272|She'd gone to the Catholic school.
p314_078|What did we learn?
p334_415|More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.
p308_322|They are there to get people into work.
p301_047|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p334_343|He's a key player in Scotland.
p334_249|That's why they go to the opera.
p334_160|That is not just my personal view.
p334_068|It was a move which appealed to him.
p334_312|The public have been very supportive.
p334_036|We could feel the heat.
p334_155|And therein lies the whole problem.
p334_285|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p277_134|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p334_421|I think it is totally wrong.
p334_063|Tomorrow night is the important game.
p334_210|You have obviously got an answer to it.
p334_411|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p334_201|Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
p334_176|But we have come under attack.
p334_276|This is a lie.
p334_261|He was sentenced to seven years.
p300_220|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p334_401|And they all had these other commitments.
p334_144|The world is split into two.
p334_185|And what was that like, as an experience?
p334_240|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p308_335|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p334_229|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p333_422|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p334_336|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p334_041|It was an accounting error.
p308_380|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p334_133|It was a simple question.
p334_393|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p300_145|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p334_131|It was just an accident of birth.
p374_290|He's very good at relating to adults.
p295_321|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p334_350|This, too, could provoke a risky business.
p334_188|No finals are to be contested today.
p374_289|Perhaps we should do the same.
p334_277|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p334_088|They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.
p334_246|He was to get his chance.
p334_040|I wanted to win so badly.
p334_237|After that it is up to the boss.
p314_207|That night was a terrible muddle.
p334_233|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p343_396|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p301_301|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p297_402|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p334_367|This was a chilling echo.
p334_394|He sat down at the piano.
p334_074|It was very personal and very intimate.
p334_189|This is not a struggle against Islam.
p311_053|We will miss him very much.
p313_415|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p297_075|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
p334_103|We should just say no.
p334_048|Times have changed, but have they improved?
p311_154|We have the easy part.
p334_164|That's as it should be.
p334_290|I want to keep him.
p334_422|It's not realistic because it's early days.
p334_269|I would recommend it.
p313_332|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p308_334|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p313_417|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p334_124|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p334_191|His English counterpart agreed.
p334_260|They would be wise to do just that.
p334_026|I want to win this thing.
p308_357|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p334_313|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p256_199|People acted too quickly.
p308_321|My players have no idea about football.
p313_406|It's going to be a new challenge.
p334_291|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p263_063|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p334_173|But the Premiership is everything to us.
p267_049|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p333_152|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p301_265|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p311_091|Some things in life you have to accept.
p334_345|She wondered why we were interested.
p334_346|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p334_408|It remains in public ownership.
p334_396|The sun is worth a million dollars.
p334_387|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p334_135|I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.
p308_398|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p292_360|Does it, Noel?
p334_203|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p334_095|I thought they played very well.
p334_259|I am getting long in the tooth.
p334_109|We have it on video.
p334_230|So far they have refused.
p300_083|They are not an item.
p306_297|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p334_392|He would take up the bike.
p334_329|I will be standing.
p334_234|He took my breath away.
p334_231|He is adamant that he is innocent.
p308_318|So, the question is, is it any good?
p334_202|We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
p334_181|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p313_319|Why is that?
p374_328|This could be a recipe for conflict.
p300_188|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p299_390|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p307_100|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p334_374|They are a very powerful and tasty side.
p299_228|This must be really short of ideas.
p334_413|The hangover was Olympian.
p313_275|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p334_292|You've been a great audience.
p334_317|It seems a little short to me.
p334_395|His condition was stable last night.
p334_195|We may make a short-term appointment.
p334_107|I didn't make those adjustments.
p374_194|This is the New Edinburgh.
p267_158|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
p334_065|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p334_252|The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution.
p334_217|That period was a struggle.
p334_386|This fight is not going to go away.
p334_303|Once we have done that, the tender will be put out.
p334_333|The attack was totally unprovoked.
p334_388|I just don't know where he is.
p233_384|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p343_351|As a nation, we must become more active.
p334_051|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p334_080|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p334_092|We already have them, all over Europe.
p323_099|It does seem a mystery.
p334_151|It is extremely sad.
p334_154|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p313_405|The Open champion is back.
p334_085|They use them for everything.
p334_079|Maybe that was the whole point.
p334_141|And that's good news for the magpies.
p334_244|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p334_056|Why do it?
p334_324|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p334_264|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p308_350|There are two games to go after that.
p334_326|The law should be changed.
p334_248|I'll always remember the horrible images.
p334_149|He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.
p307_230|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p374_398|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p334_337|With actors it is slightly different.
p334_398|I'm sure they love it.
p334_183|That is his attitude to things.
p334_161|The investment will be in the food.
p334_043|The offer of help is there for anyone.
p334_224|I can't blame the fans.
p334_288|It's the taking part that counts.
p334_298|People are fed up.
p334_031|It was no surprise.
p374_367|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p334_239|This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.
p334_273|Where was their passion, the power and feeling?
p334_198|I'm not changing my mind.
p323_227|But who cares?
p334_314|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p308_355|It was a UK-wide report.
p334_281|They'll have to pay more.
p334_099|They chose to side with terror.
p286_190|His son is a local legend.
p334_299|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p334_389|Would you take them?
p334_129|We are taking advice on this.
p308_342|I just need a bit of luck.
p334_117|He told the conference.
p334_178|What do they do, anyway?
p334_271|Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p334_360|This man is serious about his work.
p334_334|The plot is simple.
p334_297|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p300_195|I would like Glasgow.
p261_143|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p313_390|I may think about performing it.
p334_300|It's a sign of the times.
p323_350|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p334_404|We are going to change our party.
p293_120|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p334_344|He loved his children.
p308_326|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p376_310|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p334_059|It was totally my fault.
p334_341|Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
p311_026|It's ahead of Labour.
p286_122|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p299_122|They married in August last year.
p334_130|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p299_381|I'm getting back up there now.
p323_306|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p308_373|You have to audition for jobs.
p308_336|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p334_419|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p334_255|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p334_322|Then it developed into civil and criminal.
p297_143|We believe that the reason is poverty.
p311_049|What would you do if you didn't work?
p334_376|I'm delighted for Simon.
p334_414|We are here for the long term.
p308_370|I am content with the silver.
p334_390|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p334_424|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p334_327|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p334_038|He was a member of the Tartan Army.
p334_347|An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
p334_075|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p308_400|The Master was by then just too old.
p293_116|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p299_101|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p308_361|They have not let anyone into the loop.
p254_202|It's like a garage.
p308_306|We're determined to establish the facts.
p330_332|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p308_359|The discussions will surely not last too long.
p308_418|Or so she thought.
p336_035|It was another good idea.
p308_331|I'd go to bookshops.
p230_254|She took them for a term.
p308_372|This, too, could prove a risky business.
p308_388|We've got to get it right.
p308_408|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p308_389|The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.
p308_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.
p308_371|We have fun in our lives.
p329_242|I leave tonight for England.
p308_136|Do you think they would do any better?
p376_167|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p308_193|Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
p323_265|It's a very high number.
p308_376|We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.
p308_341|She's a valuable member of the Government.
p308_374|We're not comparing like with like.
p330_037|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p308_323|I'm getting long in the tooth.
p234_233|But it may not be all bad news.
p343_290|The princess has had other health problems.
p308_276|We've turned the corner.
p308_412|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p343_341|I started on fire a couple of times.
p308_186|They've two children.
p225_104|His is a success story by any standard.
p308_113|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p323_368|There are simply no orders.
p308_337|There was no hint of bravado.
p308_409|I have no argument with Scotland.
p308_393|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p329_372|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p308_363|It's not easy to live in Russia.
p330_045|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p308_353|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p259_084|It is normal for me.
p308_386|Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.
p308_008|They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p308_360|We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p308_346|Managers and clinicians must work together.
p239_258|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p308_281|We've taken steps to rectify it.
p308_236|There is a club on the rise.
p238_278|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p308_416|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p330_305|They still have the dirty work to do.
p311_211|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p311_058|I just went a bit too far.
p311_119|He decides to do something about it.
p311_110|It is not really used by many people.
p330_061|I find it rather oppressive.
p293_368|The men are safe and unharmed.
p336_225|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p311_382|And the winners are.
p330_110|The money is not really our concern.
p299_148|These matters are now behind us.
p247_410|The casualties were not named.
p311_213|It had to be more flexible.
p311_209|There has also been some Scots input.
p311_063|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p336_028|This is a very interesting move.
p293_142|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p295_387|It worked well in Monaco.
p330_158|His only reply was a laugh.
p311_321|This was another video cassette.
p311_392|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p311_310|It was the climax of the thing.
p288_072|It can be halted.
p311_304|We have worked well with them for years.
p311_294|So there is a very real dilemma.
p311_234|Where do we go from here?
p343_382|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p311_184|This may be perfectly innocent.
p311_170|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
p311_268|There is no point in denying that.
p311_341|Things don't look too good at the moment.
p311_357|They should have listened to me.
p311_128|It was a bit of a shock.
p297_269|The criteria have changed.
p311_232|We have to defend ourselves.
p311_055|They should go ahead as normal.
p311_153|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p311_314|Yes, it was uplifting.
p311_373|And then he laughs.
p261_440|It will make a huge difference.
p311_071|It's not just about the shows.
p311_387|My players are precious to me.
p330_402|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p336_166|Nobody could survive on that.
p311_300|It would have to be backdated.
p259_096|We would have concerns about that.
p295_328|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
p311_041|We must learn to finish.
p311_254|That's my daughter acting.
p311_370|So he was anxious to try something new.
p336_153|It's like an extension of your body.
p343_352|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p311_375|We don't ask for much.
p336_245|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p240_050|Who can say?
p311_311|This is new money.
p330_028|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p330_219|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p311_111|There could be no dispute about our history.
p311_270|He said he was delighted by the award.
p311_322|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p311_263|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p311_369|We have some concerns.
p330_410|What does he want him to look like?
p311_239|It's not a party, no, no.
p311_100|It is quite a new prescription.
p311_290|I am not in denial.
p293_255|In short, the club was broke.
p311_221|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p311_134|I could do a better job.
p311_372|They really want to do it.
p297_193|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p336_251|The family baton is handed on.
p311_332|The German had a point to make.
p311_200|Can you believe it?
p340_405|He said no survivors had been found.
p311_066|In the end, however, it all came together.
p311_067|He is a visionary.
p329_287|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p336_302|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p311_039|He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.
p336_198|But who will buy it?
p336_095|I believe in trade unions.
p311_289|Fame and money followed.
p336_183|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p340_179|They are just trying to cover up.
p317_262|There were no new cases yesterday.
p297_331|They are now out in the cold.
p311_097|The initial report has been completed.
p311_094|The party has never fully recovered.
p330_233|I never made any offer to Mark.
p311_309|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p293_166|It is physical but it is also good.
p311_368|I just did not cope with the pressure.
p311_256|The performance was really, really immense.
p336_374|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p297_292|He looked at me before replying.
p311_057|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p311_155|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p293_271|I was furious about it.
p336_246|It's time to say enough is enough.
p311_312|We have not given up on the game.
p245_356|It's not that clear-cut.
p311_313|The decision was left entirely to him.
p311_107|Is there anything in the wound?
p311_282|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p311_229|It should be scrapped.
p311_253|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p311_126|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p343_306|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p329_075|This will be no easy option.
p311_174|The highest rate is in Glasgow.
p311_104|But things are never the same again.
p311_129|The hearing was continued until a later date.
p311_146|They did not let him down.
p311_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
p261_255|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p311_288|It has become very confused.
p311_261|I want to go now.
p297_155|They said we were out of touch.
p311_333|This time, however, may have been different.
p311_090|It is a very special place.
p311_226|Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
p363_102|It was entirely justified.
p340_379|It feels like a winner already.
p336_321|Nobody should believe this story.
p336_350|Bomber was not amused.
p311_252|He has to pull back from the brink.
p311_356|I hope they will understand the reasons.
p311_040|We cannot go on in this fashion.
p336_310|That was me today.
p336_372|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p311_380|And it covers the spectrum.
p340_234|They didn't find any substance.
p293_399|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p311_199|She was not hard done by.
p340_187|This was an option from the beginning.
p311_139|They got the job done.
p330_176|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p311_343|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
p311_069|I have a choice.
p341_251|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p343_316|She went home from school and never returned.
p340_255|We also hope to meet the men.
p311_280|There are two ways to start a festival.
p311_225|And it paid off.
p311_143|We've not won anything yet.
p311_416|The whole process was so different.
p311_203|However, planners should be taking the lead.
p362_129|I feel it's time to make the switch.
p340_336|I think we have got the balance right.
p311_188|But we still don't know.
p311_151|You just know it.
p266_406|They were kept there for a summer.
p311_401|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
p311_136|Parole isn't a decision for me.
p297_305|Who do you think you are?
p311_354|So it goes on.
p362_406|He added that he felt undermined.
p311_132|Did he always want to be a comedian?
p311_389|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p311_260|We are still alive and kicking.
p311_365|It's unusual to say the least.
p336_338|I was in tears in the street.
p340_162|He, too, will return.
p311_384|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p329_042|There are big names.
p311_347|I've no problem with what they said.
p311_421|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p311_081|You just have to adjust.
p311_328|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p340_416|I was frustrated here.
p311_048|There are different cultures in different departments.
p311_385|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p336_078|I get the bus.
p336_116|They never got into the show this time.
p311_284|Even then this game was not over.
p311_390|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p311_264|All the children on the roll are genuine.
p311_393|She returned home a few days later.
p311_178|I was delighted with every one of them.
p311_098|He's got me very well.
p293_040|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p311_162|But no, it's not funny.
p311_121|Someone else has now got them.
p311_418|I agree with them.
p343_397|I have hardly any commitments.
p340_418|Are you watching Liverpool?
p311_339|And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
p311_191|I have no battle with the Scots.
p311_070|It happens in many countries.
p340_136|I recommend a tour.
p311_131|Planning is a key issue.
p311_274|It doesn't seem like that long ago.
p227_206|My heart is with the artist.
p311_217|This was a lot of numbers.
p311_266|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p311_395|Nobody can take it away from me.
p311_105|It is easy to agree with him.
p236_445|Taxes may need to rise.
p311_299|They're not always the same person.
p340_311|That is why we are here.
p336_329|We'll see what happens.
p311_378|We have to start again on Saturday.
p340_109|Another man said, It was horrible.
p295_357|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p311_227|Those Were The Days, indeed.
p311_358|I am greatly encouraged.
p311_324|He pretended not to care.
p311_334|You have to feel for the guy.
p311_084|They are there to help us.
p343_394|Which he is, too.
p336_241|Everyone must be focused on the league.
p293_214|The replacements made a big difference.
p311_210|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p240_296|It's like a high school play.
p311_115|Otherwise we will pay the price.
p311_166|Two options are being proposed.
p238_443|Still, some additions are inspired.
p311_275|He will do very well.
p311_423|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
p311_032|We keep a distance.
p311_413|We haven't been told.
p330_313|They also intend to travel today.
p311_038|That's what we're still trying to do.
p311_074|Already the children are dying.
p330_225|But it's just great to have won.
p311_037|They did a very good job.
p227_242|I can't wait to meet him.
p311_246|The English are coming.
p329_313|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p311_149|It's been such a waste of money.
p311_402|She is a veteran in the Balkans.
p311_376|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p252_110|He gets his moment.
p311_157|He was part of South Africa.
p311_396|She is fulfilled by it.
p297_042|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p330_314|There's a lot of hysteria.
p311_317|But don't just take my word, for it.
p311_165|There was nothing else to match it.
p295_054|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p330_394|They will now get that support.
p336_381|It is already making a difference.
p336_113|It's there for people to look at.
p297_132|But that's not the idea behind this article.
p330_147|He changed my life.
p311_296|Then there's the Old Firm.
p340_195|However, that is a sizeable if.
p336_339|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p311_242|It was just above the roof.
p295_252|What kind of festival is proposed?
p330_273|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p230_357|The professor said the results were positive.
p311_101|Johnsen is equally concerned.
p311_295|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p311_412|Of course we aren't.
p238_076|I am relishing the challenge.
p340_217|How can this be?
p311_215|It wouldn't go off.
p267_325|It is all credit to them today.
p336_074|Yet what is supposed to be said?
p317_312|He confirmed there had been no warning.
p311_042|There can be no two ways about it.
p279_157|I am very happy with life.
p311_394|They haven't run away.
p311_420|We will listen to colleagues.
p336_097|This is in a league of its own.
p311_218|Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
p299_108|He has one son and one daughter.
p311_377|I had a wonderful time working with him.
p314_069|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p311_285|Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
p239_386|Well, that's just a third district.
p311_124|This is a most serious matter.
p311_181|That will help my case a bit.
p340_028|It's a horrific incident.
p336_234|It may not be life long.
p311_308|The director's a genius.
p311_422|It's something we want to make work.
p340_086|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p311_093|It is set in Paris.
p311_095|Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
p336_082|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p311_083|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p340_146|Openness is always the best way.
p311_138|We are still the best team in Britain.
p363_394|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p311_198|It is that sort of film.
p311_316|This is not out of choice.
p336_311|That is when we are really effective.
p336_122|In that case, the children were not missing.
p311_362|I hope he would have been very pleased.
p340_116|I have done ever since it was published.
p311_340|This Government is cutting taxes.
p297_165|Don't get me wrong.
p311_068|I was the trial judge in both.
p311_047|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p311_080|We've got a job to do.
p329_064|We're not the tourist board.
p311_391|I had to calm down.
p295_238|The party will make up its own mind.
p330_277|The film has also been superbly designed.
p311_204|I'm very frightened of the dark.
p295_316|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p311_206|This has been a shock.
p311_114|It is nearly there.
p311_330|If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.
p311_269|The kids are paying the price.
p311_383|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p311_050|They are already on the way there.
p329_065|It was the same old story.
p279_077|It seemed so personal.
p311_318|But this one has a lot of potential.
p297_332|The way ahead is not easy.
p311_243|It has changed, and not for the better.
p311_043|I knew my contract was up this year.
p330_152|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p295_351|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p311_167|They haven't been thought through.
p311_238|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p336_133|It has been declared.
p311_122|But once again it was not converted.
p343_301|It was a matter of chance.
p263_039|No company would want to put their people at risk.
p263_430|Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
p263_049|I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
p263_436|As it turned out it was a triumph.
p314_196|We will reform the welfare state.
p263_269|It should have taken a year for a company this size.
p263_084|The insurance company is only interested in your profits.
p286_281|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p263_402|He replied that it was a dilemma.
p330_353|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p241_239|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p241_344|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p230_048|It was bound to happen.
p257_190|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p263_465|It was another reminder of the power of an image.
p263_414|Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
p263_393|She has a little boy.
p263_166|Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
p263_401|He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
p230_164|Our position remains the same.
p263_092|The first few days will determine whether she can survive.
p263_064|I am pleased to be in them.
p263_375|And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.
p263_186|Time is now very short.
p261_095|You are like an animal.
p263_150|Next time round, it will be different.
p226_347|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p263_321|Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
p263_046|That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
p281_330|It's difficult to predict the future.
p263_426|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p263_467|Tickets will be at a premium.
p263_383|The bank was now involved.
p263_189|The region is open for business.
p340_043|We can hardly talk about it.
p263_087|The damage from the fire was huge.
p263_470|There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
p263_324|I could not have hoped to run at this level.
p274_446|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p263_438|I can't wait for the season to end.
p261_286|They can leave at any time.
p263_334|There is no plan B.
p263_463|To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
p263_363|The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.
p263_424|We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
p263_208|It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
p263_261|You look like a rugby player.
p263_304|In the end, it was no choice.
p225_045|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p225_320|We have a good healthy debate.
p263_153|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
p263_400|They have put in a lot of time and effort.
p263_181|The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
p225_201|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p343_319|It is not easy to live in Russia.
p234_172|I have had a good life.
p263_165|However, she did not report the matter to the police.
p263_256|The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
p263_427|But we are severely limited in funds.
p256_037|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p287_191|It is hard to tell.
p234_065|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p263_215|This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
p263_158|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p297_100|The body follows the mind.
p230_109|Abbey National is an option.
p340_045|I have lost all confidence.
p263_267|The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
p236_286|Much of the equipment was new.
p263_421|Today, the story is different.
p263_351|Overall, we are very pleased.
p263_279|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p263_445|No, because it was too many.
p257_409|It goes with the job.
p273_161|I did not have a bet on myself.
p263_455|However, one has arrived in the post.
p263_099|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p263_395|I was just happy to get my own goal.
p286_298|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
p263_294|It will always be the highlight of my career.
p225_169|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
s5_243|It is just a tax on employment.
p263_126|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p263_472|It's just a place to open it.
p263_345|Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
p227_106|It is safe in our hands.
p263_298|Its body language is all wrong.
p273_376|It was like a weekly wage.
p263_461|The rest of the business is very robust.
p263_457|He looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
p263_058|I've got to provide for my family.
p225_121|You get a lot for your money.
p263_169|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p263_331|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p237_178|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p263_192|It makes no influence on the public.
p286_263|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
p227_089|You might not make it.
p269_191|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p263_226|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
p297_035|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p263_095|It might change your life.
p323_089|An announcement will follow in due course.
p254_397|I can lead by example.
p263_130|It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
p287_106|Mr Blair should be warned.
p234_355|However, a bid was never made.
p263_449|The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
p233_082|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p263_035|I could not do it.
p263_431|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p263_318|Nothing has been put into action.
p263_200|We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
p263_471|That should get their attention.
p263_090|Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
p248_095|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p259_467|They offer a kind of narrative.
p263_469|I just got under the ball a bit.
p281_431|Together, we can make a difference.
p257_084|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p333_251|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p263_270|We were not allowed to go to help them.
p251_314|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p263_454|Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
p263_350|Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
p227_330|There's still a bit to go.
p263_096|No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
p317_356|We're not an employment agency.
p340_212|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p263_389|This season has been a nightmare.
p263_193|I thought he did very well.
p234_317|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p263_246|That will be the criteria for the future.
p267_395|We shall not be moved.
p247_106|Our preference is to play in midweek.
p251_144|We have seen a copy of the report.
p225_059|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p247_449|He deserves a second chance.
p267_381|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p263_206|Two years later, she was dead.
p263_404|He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.
p263_441|You have got to be careful.
p263_462|I saw it didn't work.
p261_474|My place is in the kitchen.
p263_408|It was an amazing afternoon.
p293_206|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p263_442|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
p263_191|The championship is different from the other majors.
p263_266|We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
p263_045|It seemed the tough times were behind him.
p341_128|It is crucial for both teams.
p263_447|I believed that effort was needed in our own area.
p263_154|It is the quality of the work that counts.
p263_385|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p225_235|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
p263_132|I told him I was a long time ago.
p261_465|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
p273_432|It is not a standing army.
p341_218|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p240_277|Access has been a nightmare.
p263_313|I have decided to stand down from the list.
p263_069|It is the only way forward for the club.
p340_129|It is the same old story.
p340_169|It has been a waste of time.
p263_326|The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
p227_146|Like the others, he was arrested.
p299_139|I had a tie in my hand.
p336_354|No decisions have been made in this respect.
p225_144|She will do for me.
p263_047|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p263_133|They have to come clean.
p263_284|I was delighted with the way he jumped.
p263_357|The pain was almost too much to bear.
p257_343|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p227_127|Any success would have been an improvement.
p263_057|It will now take over the running of the estate.
p248_105|That all hope is never lost.
p263_042|This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
p277_377|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p263_168|The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
p225_299|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p263_405|MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
p239_462|She failed in her action.
p263_030|We would like to find another region to develop in England.
p263_144|The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
p336_371|It looked like a war zone.
p267_034|I became a widow overnight.
p226_082|It is a terrible place.
p227_310|We are not increasing the number.
p227_085|The latter is due to be finished in February.
p227_396|It is a terrible equation.
p297_330|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p227_233|The fight is under way.
p227_086|This is a complex and detailed report.
p227_251|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
p227_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
p227_068|He had been a singer.
p286_156|He's not a Celtic man.
p233_102|It is much as it has been described.
p361_267|It is difficult to say.
p227_137|Our position is quite simple.
p267_345|They were the acts of men.
p233_053|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p227_314|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
p227_194|Trading conditions have not been that bad.
p273_217|William Hague delighted his party.
p227_188|We've just had it confirmed.
p227_249|It is possible to be too good.
p227_392|That's not like us at all.
p227_130|He is a great addition to our team.
p227_250|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p227_361|A report is expected next month.
p227_359|I am very interested in the subject.
p230_360|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p227_113|However, we have to be cautious.
p363_222|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p273_045|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p227_196|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
p330_044|Our decision making was poor.
p227_189|A copy of the report will be sent to them.
p227_312|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
p227_350|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
p225_142|Well, you can have a tree.
p227_321|I have got a victim.
p227_386|I do not like to lose.
p227_387|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
p227_126|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
p227_092|For once, you should believe the hype.
p286_216|This will be our new beginning.
p227_203|It was served by sheriff officers.
p227_104|And the match was not too bad, either.
p227_171|The people are the hero.
p363_249|I can hardly believe it.
p287_281|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p267_273|Not many companies can say that these days.
p227_149|That was the difference between the sides.
p227_333|It is so easy to be negative.
p227_207|That might mean another delay.
p281_068|I have proved that in the past.
p227_177|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p227_370|We need to be prepared.
p234_239|However, it is not as simple as this.
p317_051|These men are a part of India.
p227_180|That will apply to both sets of fans.
p227_345|The king is delighted by the honour.
p281_380|I wanted to go out on a high.
p227_199|He made no order on costs.
p227_374|It has been made to entertain.
p234_269|There is a world of difference.
p227_161|They want to see him.
p227_131|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
p267_153|We are still getting over it.
p247_476|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p230_271|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p227_294|But the plot is not the point.
p227_181|I think it's a good sign.
p267_357|It is a stroke of genius.
p227_026|Movement has to take place.
p277_457|It is a vicious circle.
p239_246|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p227_327|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
p227_043|I'd come back from London.
p261_356|I've got a sense of humour, too.
p227_237|We can certainly build on this.
p234_313|Every one is a winner.
p227_176|But he has a lifeline.
p227_135|We could easily have lost that game.
p281_436|Size is not the issue.
p227_044|If I was a woman.
p227_103|It was never a starter.
p227_342|Have a look at this lot.
p236_479|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p236_291|My body is a wreck.
p225_296|It goes back a long way.
p234_243|Was everything done to save people?
p227_382|This will impact on us.
p227_190|This is the time to use it.
p227_331|I'm not worried about the critics.
p227_358|Of course, we want to go home.
p227_343|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p227_174|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p225_141|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p227_230|He must get to know himself.
p261_439|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p227_136|This is a limited market.
p227_390|Celtic were pleased to help.
p236_267|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p317_365|He would help me with the form.
p273_346|The strong pound also took its toll.
p227_197|The force is with them.
p227_306|It is an amazing response.
p336_190|The weekly average was three hours.
p279_280|They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
p279_399|I have been in good form for the last two years.
p232_181|The clarity is vital.
p255_046|Life is good.
p269_385|He denied the charge.
p279_187|It's a joke.
p374_093|It doesn't always work that way.
p279_292|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
p251_367|He has seen the past.
p232_400|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
p279_222|He's a nice guy.
p288_142|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p279_402|What would be the point?
p241_129|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p292_397|I am immensely sad.
p259_205|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p330_298|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p269_116|My office is bare.
p279_290|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
p279_217|By hard work, is the answer.
p261_274|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p237_137|It's perfectly feasible.
p245_132|They did very well.
p245_355|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p279_394|He's already made history.
p279_234|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p232_252|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p279_289|It was hopeless.
p341_369|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p294_146|You ask the question.
p306_251|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p313_362|It was the same at Twickenham.
p295_268|This latter point is hugely important.
p241_296|It just came into my head that day.
p251_210|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p269_343|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p295_239|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p279_369|He has the edge.
p301_091|People love to see this stuff.
p363_383|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p248_026|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p279_333|It will be very, very tight.
p254_387|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p288_037|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p299_168|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p233_382|The road was closed for several hours.
p266_409|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p279_259|they fail to engage.
p245_055|He had no enemies.
p279_134|It will be too hot.
p233_136|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p248_139|It was typical.
p254_102|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p237_072|The end result is precisely the same.
p343_151|He pleaded for caution.
p248_088|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p240_341|Who was the mystery MP?
p251_107|It had been played at festivals.
p305_141|I haven't made the donation yet.
p255_084|It's never too late.
p247_356|Other people had looked at it.
p248_317|He was unable to come.
p306_117|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p237_070|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p233_118|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p269_349|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p226_062|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p323_375|But the fans deserve to know!
p257_197|It's just awful.
p245_284|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p245_178|It was still there, but right at the end.
p288_223|It was good fun.
p248_328|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
p306_126|There is a lack of chemistry.
p248_297|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p271_094|He was possessed
p269_039|That's no bad thing.
p248_333|I said that I had been raped.
p248_348|But nothing happened.
p273_224|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p341_306|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p251_267|We run within the law.
p232_247|She is well balanced.
p241_175|And I saw the light!
p305_223|The parents will have a great time, too.
p248_216|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p257_199|IT S all in the hair.
p248_316|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
p248_033|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p257_058|It is not great art.
p233_349|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p256_028|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p254_369|Five members were disciplined.
p257_422|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p300_047|But the law is very clear on this.
p248_151|It is huge.
p256_287|It's very safe.
p269_123|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p288_333|Donald was his friend.
p256_307|It is no surprise.
p256_085|It may well have been.
p248_266|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p259_048|They had to explain it.
p259_194|I cannot say too much about them.
p340_403|I had a ball today.
p269_136|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p232_079|He is now resident in England.
p261_139|Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
p261_280|The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
p234_209|I will be in Scotland.
p247_102|But it is up again.
p236_043|Their campaign is in disarray.
p261_185|I had too much to drink.
p261_469|They are defined by law.
p261_250|It is now the big brother.
p287_270|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p239_427|This idea has been around for four years.
p261_350|Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
p273_048|I must take a seat.
p259_080|Our mother is very worried.
p281_190|He prefers to play for them.
p361_073|It is on the news.
p287_233|This is a family club.
p236_197|That is a waste of energy.
p267_313|You will never get a conviction.
p261_025|They are very clever in their use of words.
p261_067|That's not the intention at all.
p363_346|You did not see it.
p299_129|The case will now go to appeal.
p261_128|I have accepted the challenge.
p261_151|But I am still awaiting an answer.
p234_140|Actors like to be in the centre.
p261_316|That is the general feeling.
p261_090|However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
p261_068|It starts with the script.
p267_171|It is a body blow.
p261_220|It has been like that all year for me.
p261_281|The offer will run for the next three weekends.
p234_357|The City welcomed the numbers.
p259_322|We will deliver at director level.
p225_036|It was a close call.
p261_230|A terrorist is a terrorist.
p230_227|It was a day for records.
p273_388|We operate as a Scottish company.
p261_347|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p292_419|But a surprise is in store.
p261_102|We are also looking for new licences.
p287_133|I would relish the prospect.
p261_362|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p374_142|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p281_425|That's the way it works.
p261_326|It is a potential danger.
p246_088|Tony Blair said as little.
p261_445|The first game is so important.
p261_031|I have never been a member of the council.
p287_235|I was ready for this.
p261_123|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p232_355|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p236_039|That was the case with David.
p261_443|It is a case of pity for us.
p230_199|The result is called a patent.
p261_450|You have to see the work.
p329_305|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p281_349|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p261_229|Life is too short to be bitter.
p261_135|The others have all been in storage for some time.
p330_299|Motion described it as a unique event.
p261_251|They showed a lot of heart.
p261_222|Seven people were critically injured.
p261_211|I chose to go by the rules.
p261_376|He took a draw on his cigarette.
p295_178|It was far from business as usual.
p261_345|This ruling is a farce.
p236_448|No options are excluded at all.
p261_384|We regret that they were brought in the first place.
p261_473|War is not the action.
p261_418|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p293_295|Construction is due to begin in February.
p343_137|All the pressure will be on him.
p286_133|Structural changes were also required.
p292_409|It is good for Europe.
p261_204|It was his own decision.
p261_471|I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
p261_075|These people are not big names.
p261_460|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
p261_328|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
p230_245|I was just a kid.
p261_346|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p261_457|No one wants to go through these things.
p261_247|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
p261_305|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
p232_365|However, it was well worth the wait.
p363_211|A senior party insider said.
p239_290|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p362_039|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p230_362|I am a lucky man.
p261_461|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
p261_254|It was a poor performance.
p261_288|It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
p261_314|His was a huge success story.
p261_243|It is the loss of my name.
p261_444|Gordon is also highly rated.
p274_466|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p273_168|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p329_062|I am still pretty young in this business.
p292_173|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p329_243|There is no change in our position.
p329_402|People ask about the concept of a team.
p329_423|What will happen if it all goes wrong?
p329_377|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p293_329|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p329_350|I just had so much fun.
p329_120|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p329_153|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p329_359|Pray that it is so.
p329_296|That would have been too easy.
p329_286|The manager is there to make these decisions.
p307_040|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p329_165|That's the way it is.
p307_127|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p314_126|But then he changed his mind.
p329_069|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p329_096|Jamming would be equally difficult.
p257_434|The bill would be massive.
p329_280|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p329_339|I'll take the blame for that.
p329_342|There is great interest on our island.
p329_195|It is a scandal.
p259_059|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p329_224|It is a step on the way.
p299_282|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p329_106|The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
p329_398|The issue has still to be resolved.
p293_262|The Commons is too outdated.
p329_417|It is so elusive and light.
p329_040|We know you will not let us down.
p329_108|It may be argued.
p329_335|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p329_333|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p329_148|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p323_391|Later they changed their minds.
p293_210|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p305_039|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p305_041|Players were held in equally low regard.
p305_118|We've come from a long way back.
p374_144|I see the extended family once a year.
p329_080|We will see how he is after treatment.
p329_246|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p301_165|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p329_363|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p329_405|They've been here before.
p329_376|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p329_329|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p329_367|So what does one do?
p329_306|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p329_034|We don't know the scale of need.
p298_371|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p329_045|I hope you will leave it at that.
p305_037|Who has he fought?
p329_354|Their mind was already made up.
p305_025|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p329_265|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p298_386|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p329_113|It has been hijacked.
p293_341|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p329_338|It might have been a satanic ritual.
p329_094|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p329_147|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p329_228|All businesses continue to trade.
p329_154|The whole experience has left me bitter.
p292_370|And how he kept his word.
p314_112|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
p329_099|This kind of problem arises everywhere.
p305_026|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p329_200|But these were the nights.
p329_300|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p301_204|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p329_384|It is a dilemma.
p329_387|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p329_298|This is not a faceless system.
p329_229|It's a difficult job.
p298_384|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p329_088|He just wants to play.
p329_343|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p298_359|I was happiest with my short game.
p329_302|I'm feeling very pleased.
p329_395|And that started me thinking.
p329_314|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p329_068|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p329_258|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p329_166|We've been calling for a level playing field.
p329_253|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p329_374|But we could not change his mind.
p329_051|I didn't have a clue.
p329_027|It's not a solo.
p298_379|I have beaten her a few times.
p329_122|David was not either.
p329_315|There is no threat to them.
p269_108|It was quite rigorous.
p329_334|That is not the way we should operate.
p298_397|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p329_394|As if he were a High Court judge.
p317_027|Yet it is all for two good causes.
p329_150|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p329_245|We went on to become very successful.
p329_361|There was support from across the board.
p329_355|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p329_337|We have nothing to hide.
p314_032|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p329_168|I am not a magician.
p297_369|We make good weapons.
p329_397|It brings together two essential elements.
p329_112|They could not hear.
p376_331|I have so much respect for him.
p305_335|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p329_248|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p305_029|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p329_388|They did not interfere.
p329_176|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p329_083|I don't know why she is not here.
p329_134|Is that too much to ask?
p329_219|We find this very sad.
p329_119|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p305_042|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p329_381|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p329_292|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p329_118|That is different from being impartial.
p298_400|The South African defended his work ethic.
p305_040|It would show them a positive way forward.
p305_030|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p329_076|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p329_310|The campaign was raucous.
p239_124|He was just a journalist.
p329_283|We are taking it seriously.
p329_213|We did not talk about it.
p329_266|I hope he stays.
p297_185|There is no guarantee.
p329_236|It really was a masterful innings.
p329_177|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p329_085|There are no excuses.
p329_404|The film is about the cost of genius.
p329_152|Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
p323_206|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
p293_317|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p374_259|The court has not decided.
p329_272|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p329_206|We will not break even.
p329_174|She had experience of the wildest places.
p329_073|He would be with his peers.
p317_228|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p329_422|The country is in a state of chaos.
p329_170|There was even a joke.
p297_189|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p329_081|I was there for five hours.
p329_347|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p329_036|We had a huge response to that campaign.
p329_031|I had found my vision.
p329_239|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p329_365|We have been preparing all year.
p307_173|Our young people are leaving.
p329_247|We must learn from the past.
p329_308|Clearly, that is important in nursing.
p329_185|They responded with victories.
p329_161|It will be a great night.
p329_357|You don't do the same thing with men.
p329_345|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p329_274|I'd never heard him in person before.
p329_418|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p298_368|It was also put on the Internet.
p298_378|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p329_362|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p329_189|I think it's awful.
p329_077|I am so sorry.
p329_331|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p307_306|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p268_181|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p305_044|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p329_223|I'm really happy with the way it went.
p329_326|There was barely a handful of chances.
p329_126|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p329_279|That's a very strong element.
p329_414|He was not seeking special advantage.
s5_174|No, is the answer to your first question.
p329_097|Drugs are always an issue.
p329_114|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p329_238|I would urge the Government to think again.
p329_316|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p329_391|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p305_034|We have high hopes that this will work.
p329_252|I have no comment to make.
p329_373|They probably expected something special from me.
p329_312|But both were involved with other matters.
p329_290|We had no part in it.
p313_386|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p298_370|Now that was a boxing movie.
p305_038|I want a free vote.
p329_235|This is my new career.
p329_277|He doesn't do dinner.
p329_030|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p329_349|That is absolute nonsense.
p329_340|It is now time for justice.
p293_261|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p329_191|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p329_352|It is a decision which has paid off.
p329_330|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p329_144|The other children were severely mentally impaired.
p329_078|This avalanche is just beginning.
p300_307|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p245_102|I have had no social life at all.
p305_143|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p234_249|You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
p225_237|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p234_036|It was sold at a loss.
p234_166|At the moment we do not understand it.
p234_336|This could be a mistake.
p363_049|I was not overly concerned about this.
p234_154|There is a spring in the step.
p234_038|Victory was never in doubt.
p234_099|That is the fact of the matter.
p234_310|Scotland won by six wickets.
p234_117|And we had a good response.
p233_055|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
p234_296|The results are expected within days.
p234_069|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
p234_030|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p234_149|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p234_104|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p234_127|However, it was a different story in the final.
p234_327|But it is important for a number of reasons.
p230_074|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p233_106|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p273_238|We were well worth the win.
p234_323|And he's the real thing.
p233_097|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
p234_060|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p234_255|The world is a good place.
p361_384|We want this place to work.
p234_131|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
p234_168|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p234_211|The trading conditions are not good.
p234_231|He is a good friend.
p268_051|The man became a reporter.
p234_230|He intends to restart in the spring.
p233_096|I had a bit in hand.
p234_339|I think the overall picture is still strong.
p234_268|Then was the summer of their discontent.
p234_047|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p234_113|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
p234_349|We are not interested in dividends.
p234_227|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p234_128|The end result is the same.
p267_252|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p234_229|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
p234_153|That is the nature of the game.
p234_110|We are currently working on the details.
p234_042|He was in his element.
p247_129|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p234_189|It is simply not true.
p234_084|It is not a story.
p234_158|The players were under pressure.
p234_202|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
p234_356|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p234_066|He has not been dropped.
p233_057|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
p234_253|It was just another play.
p234_184|They were not seeking the right to strike.
p234_092|They have a further report to make in March.
p234_277|That would be a danger.
p234_148|It is expected to last a week.
p234_343|The market is the market.
p234_328|All of the management has invested in the firm.
p233_103|Police said the family was helping with the search.
p233_072|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p234_176|I was in a hole.
p234_282|My view has always been the same.
p234_203|We can take the city.
p234_285|Do you think we're a top nation?
p234_329|The family is not interested in the value of the house.
p234_340|That is always a problem.
p234_302|But it was also hard.
p234_160|There is no common ground.
p340_273|I am delighted for them.
p314_039|His concern is only for the future.
p234_118|When we looked at the company.
p234_035|History is in the making.
p234_190|In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
p234_178|I was always in control.
p234_109|It is not affected by the sale.
p234_105|He has become a monster.
p273_237|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p234_217|Being investor ready is a good start.
p234_064|It was an amazing result.
p230_025|It is on the internet.
p234_210|It was the story of the second half.
p234_129|Three days later, he was killed.
p234_050|The strategy is not without risk.
p234_264|Scotland played a major part in the project.
p234_054|We are working on it.
p234_214|This is an interesting link.
p234_157|I have a lot of confidence in this team.
p234_316|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
p234_186|Tony Blair has had a good conference.
p234_048|It is all starting to come together.
p295_300|It should be a condition of employment.
p234_201|They have to get that sorted.
p225_239|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p236_271|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p233_026|But we will have to wait.
p234_061|You have to be patient.
p234_112|That would be a serious problem.
p234_306|They are not going the length of the pitch.
p234_257|The matter is under appeal.
p251_203|The conference is the first test.
p234_133|He had no money left to run the club.
p234_297|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
p234_098|I cannot wait to get started on it.
p236_318|They have to be addressed.
p233_108|In London today, it was business as usual.
p233_076|We can all make a mistake.
p234_344|We do not have the papers.
p234_312|And we can do it.
p234_350|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p234_159|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
p234_271|Well, it was certainly different.
p234_320|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
p234_218|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
p233_080|On the night, it was not enough.
p238_344|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p234_083|They were badly prepared for it.
p287_185|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p234_114|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
p234_347|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p343_293|I could not sit in the stands.
p239_477|We did something about it.
p234_121|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p234_358|Something is going to have to give.
p234_223|He must have a crack at it.
p233_071|She did that for the rest of her life.
p234_318|The existing structure is in trouble.
p234_216|It was a management problem in the hospital.
p234_111|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
p233_062|That is all in the past.
p234_315|They have set the standard.
p234_044|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p234_346|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
p233_063|That could be a mistake.
p234_220|This conference was never confirmed.
p232_237|However, no further action was taken by police.
p287_131|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p234_115|She is not a victim.
p234_266|Not in this production he doesn't.
p234_361|We never played at all.
p234_134|It is not so simple.
p234_193|The performance is not there.
p234_332|But it can be done.
p273_312|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p233_093|He is in the US.
p234_126|He wanted to record the group.
p234_130|We are committed to the ban.
p343_062|But that's another story for another day.
p236_075|The Festival is prepared to help.
p233_040|We are the party of the future.
p234_232|It is the strength of the school.
p234_197|He has defended the system.
p234_155|We want to get there.
p234_345|However, the devil is in the detail.
p239_105|This time, it might be for real.
p236_181|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p281_136|People come from all round the world to see it.
p281_163|Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
p281_456|We could hardly believe it.
p281_304|We are not doing the Today programme.
p281_437|It was support as it should be.
p281_414|We will stand for the nation.
p281_281|The demand is created by the supply.
p281_100|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p281_063|The standard is extremely high.
p281_413|He seems to be used to the attention.
p281_132|He wants to win a major.
p281_076|There could be a lot of confusion.
p281_356|It is all about having physical evidence.
p361_313|I am not ready to walk away.
p238_081|We should be able to cope.
p277_421|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
p287_097|It's not a lack of confidence.
p286_172|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p281_067|It is a real problem.
p281_373|The shares are a strong hold.
p286_131|Then again, we could have.
p274_449|It is pretty bad news.
p273_178|Because he was born in England.
p281_139|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p281_059|It was a lovely experience.
p281_052|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p281_273|England could only play the other team on the park.
p225_290|Scotch beef is badly missed.
p281_341|It's just the way I play.
p281_329|There is no shortage of farmers.
p281_305|There should be room for creative dissent.
p281_244|Wilson will tell the truth.
p281_457|The men are very worried.
p238_264|It is a terrible tragedy.
p281_460|It must never be seen as second class.
p230_274|We feel very good about it.
p281_300|He added that the business was in good shape.
p281_308|The real issue is personal.
p274_387|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p286_399|In fact, he was great today.
p236_284|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p281_366|There will be no final dividend.
p281_426|The professor is in no doubt.
p376_269|It was the same expression of joy.
p336_253|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
p236_112|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p267_178|The referee had a good game.
p281_268|That would depend on the parole board.
p281_253|The pig industry is on its knees.
p230_091|The conclusion is the same.
p281_173|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p281_121|We have a training class.
p281_097|We must stop it with the golf ball.
p236_217|John Daly has a burning ambition.
p267_082|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p361_133|IT is called a killing in the trade.
p281_087|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p281_096|But I know the course.
p287_155|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
p281_110|That is the only way forward.
p330_182|The actor has met with Mandela.
p236_342|It was almost too much.
p287_424|Both promotions come as no surprise.
p281_223|You have got to look at speed of response.
p225_253|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p281_430|Once again, they would be wrong.
p281_353|I think this proposal is excellent.
p281_421|Footballers have also been targeted.
p281_355|He deserves a top team.
p281_332|But the Farmer is bemused.
p252_196|Scottish Life was there over one year.
p236_220|You are a great player.
p362_114|He had returned to die.
p267_036|A week is a long time in politics.
p281_205|It was a test in itself.
p281_320|Scotland has shown the way.
p286_442|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p281_113|Or it would have been.
p281_111|They are at a very early stage.
p247_373|Neither woman has been named.
p297_345|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p281_074|The players will be down.
p281_323|I can see their argument.
p341_148|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p281_250|That is still in place.
p281_375|There was a thing in front of the camera.
p281_278|For him then it's a labour of love.
p281_086|The error appeared in a warrant.
p281_347|It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
p281_443|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
p281_130|There were no serious injuries.
p281_112|The whole thing is the music.
p281_197|That would be my view.
p267_083|There was no way back for United after that.
p282_045|They want to be entertained.
p271_387|It is unusual.
p287_258|We are in a war.
p266_341|But I was knocked out by the city.
p266_415|He was really great.
p267_097|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p323_139|I can give no comment.
p282_094|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p266_091|It's good news.
p266_129|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p259_360|You may have a short memory.
p255_355|It was one in the afternoon.
p233_376|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p271_412|He got his degree.
p253_101|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p266_227|They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
p266_421|Such as it is.
p236_438|I chose to make a film.
p294_371|We recorded it at our own expense.
p266_340|Maloney was asked.
p246_266|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p266_307|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
p266_164|We need a new kind of theatre.
p266_292|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p255_364|Not so, it seems.
p266_299|We lost a boy.
p266_365|He was also a great man.
p266_404|It's an absolute nonsense.
p266_418|That may be.
p251_289|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p266_234|It's a killer piece.
p271_448|We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
p271_438|Admission is free.
p271_427|I'm very grateful.
p271_336|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p271_440|In it went.
p271_196|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p282_353|And he laughs.
p277_036|Was it worth it?
p277_433|We were used.
p271_220|That idea is rubbish.
p271_445|They were not even allowed to see them.
p277_431|We are all equal.
p271_044|They said she was stable.
p333_252|Who will provide the wine?
p341_224|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p271_170|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
p271_138|He should resign.
p271_358|My husband was angry.
p299_237|I hate the word.
p257_425|It is bizarre.
p271_099|It is home-grown.
p253_158|Words were not required.
p271_433|Everything has collapsed.
p271_428|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p271_114|I am an actor.
p374_291|It opened last month.
p271_104|I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
p232_180|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p271_451|It was ignored.
p294_202|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p292_073|We are just being flooded.
p297_147|We had a really good experience with David.
p314_270|I'm not talking about his career.
p297_335|His primary residence is Scotland.
p297_311|Bob Dylan's getting old.
p297_418|Now he is trying to downgrade the media.
p297_074|Subtle it is not.
p297_350|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p340_209|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p297_243|But they didn't much like that.
p343_346|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
p297_250|That is how it will be judged.
p297_113|This ruling is unfair to everyone.
p297_103|However, what is his calibre?
p297_266|England against France is always a big game.
p297_389|I hope the voters will respond.
p297_337|You are going to take away my life.
p294_052|The course record was in his name.
p297_211|That's hard for a woman.
p363_423|He said he had no reports of casualties.
p297_234|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
p297_036|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
p297_137|He needed a kidney - it's as simple as that.
p297_041|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p297_279|Part of England, is not?
p297_312|Our number one goal is prevention.
p297_401|But every country has its own character.
p297_342|Don't hold your breath.
p297_239|Europe is not a threat to Britain.
p297_151|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p306_130|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p297_116|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
p336_305|We meet again in Berlin.
p292_166|We want to replicate that success.
p297_130|It's unsafe for society.
p297_327|You will never replace the child.
p274_276|I couldn't honestly tell you.
p297_219|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p236_367|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p336_208|So, where do we go from here?
p317_373|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
p236_259|It was quite a new prescription.
p317_174|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p297_304|That, too, was over two years ago.
p297_346|It was blown out of proportion.
p297_072|It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.
p314_298|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p363_130|Which brings us to the question of money.
p297_246|However we're capable of beating them.
p297_212|THE atmosphere was electric.
p376_155|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p297_025|But it's been kept to a minimum.
p297_352|It is only one night, after all.
p363_417|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p297_421|It'`	s the tip of the iceberg.
p297_240|He just wants to leave a legacy.
p317_370|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p297_088|Do something that you haven't done before.
p297_210|He's an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p297_271|Who reminded him about the score?
p287_356|Appointments should be made on merit.
p313_226|From our point of view, it's the right time.
p297_333|He intends to appeal the sentences.
p374_412|It's always the same, isn't it?
p297_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p297_291|That's a trend which will be encouraged.
p297_078|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
p297_109|You need insurance to bring people in.
p313_165|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p297_264|That's the last thing they need.
p297_338|That was one very hard game.
p288_220|You have to do your research.
p333_071|Every game against New Zealand is.
p297_067|BIG Brother is listening to you.
p297_196|I was just doing my job.
p297_183|I read it every year.
p297_162|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
p297_071|They can be time consuming.
p297_328|I'm delighted at Murray's appointment.
p297_121|The General Election is all to play for.
p297_385|One might think that is a power.
p297_382|I don't want a burial service.
p297_207|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p297_169|I'm going to buy a car.
p297_026|We have gone on about him no end.
p297_283|This is wrong, but that's believed.
p297_343|The girls are ready to compete.
p297_119|It's an expensive part of their equipment.
p294_063|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p364_235|They were assured that it would.
p317_243|It's like English in its underwear.
p336_193|This is the start of a slippery slope.
p297_377|All of us in Scotland should be vigilant.
p297_238|He's a sort of mystery figure.
p297_383|And it's time for new leadership.
p297_344|O, Is there anything in the wound?
p330_172|After that, we made some changes.
p286_367|I think we'll just keep it.
p297_336|It's an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p294_080|One policeman was killed.
p297_159|The captaincy will help that, too.
p297_040|I am writing a novel.
p297_276|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
p333_052|This is the same old story.
p297_282|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p297_277|It does not move, which is amazing.
p297_032|Jack McConnell will be making a statement tomorrow.
p297_139|It's not a great art.
p297_228|I will let you in on a secret.
p297_237|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p317_273|We are committed to urgent action.
p297_290|Taxation should be simplified.
p297_233|We need a visionary producer.
p333_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p297_403|In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.
p297_261|She was charged with perjury.
p297_060|The tribunal continues today.
p297_111|What was it like playing real people?
p297_135|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
p336_157|I want my audience to be challenged.
p297_391|I believe that gap is nearly there.
p361_381|They will give it a couple of years.
p297_220|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
p297_046|Except for this, it was offside.
p297_347|We certainly hope we have been successful.
p297_324|I'll never have problems with any football managers.
p297_392|This is the real thing now.
p297_293|But today was the real big one.
p297_120|Our lives have been turned upside down.
p306_054|He was shocked by what he saw.
p294_029|I was pregnant and very worried.
p297_096|However, their reaction could not have been more different.
p297_413|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
p297_245|I am sorry to hear this news.
p297_222|There has been no reaction from them.
p297_027|And the art of performance is taking risks.
p317_339|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p336_052|He died from multiple injuries.
p313_191|We have understood the problems for some time.
p297_161|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p305_194|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p297_144|It's my nature.
p297_362|He had lost his confidence again.
p297_321|He was caught and fired.
p343_106|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
p297_273|I will not walk away from this job.
p297_317|He confirmed that there had been no warning.
p297_258|The farmers had no choice in the matter.
p297_102|It isn't just a defining issue for them.
p341_030|Gilbert was not amused.
p297_063|Nobody can get at them there.
p294_055|We should not bring him into a dispute.
p294_358|No decision on that was taken.
p294_192|You can't believe a word.
p294_374|We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.
p294_411|It raises the edge.
p341_190|We are on the path of change.
p294_360|The trial continues today.
p294_065|People remember the Tories in office.
p294_243|But happily, the story is true.
p294_130|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p294_283|This is our unfinished business.
p294_221|The six others were injured.
p294_345|Where are you taking her?
p294_151|It's like a score in some ways.
p294_213|We are very, very pleased with the response.
p294_398|No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
p294_223|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p294_391|Calvin was back at his best today.
p294_241|I couldn't have asked for better.
p294_220|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
p293_332|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p294_148|We are all very proud of her.
p361_050|It is the tip of the iceberg.
p294_056|This is a possible way forward.
p361_219|This has gone on too long.
p233_228|Mental health is a massive issue.
p294_300|There was no happiness.
p323_051|What's it for?
p294_244|They are not suitable.
p323_243|The result could be all down to turnout.
p294_404|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p323_081|General, You didn't get a modified.
p294_051|Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.
p294_200|When it is ready, it will be signed.
p295_423|The document is a starting point for discussion.
p294_207|It will take some time to establish.
p294_235|We're talking about one or two years.
p294_170|We have managed to get it under control.
p294_026|The show is sold out, like the others in the run.
p294_057|I am not here to get even.
p294_238|They will do nothing for the local people.
p294_281|I've never seen them down here.
p294_174|These things can happen.
p336_388|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p294_189|The First Minister is an addict.
p294_291|There did not need to be a miracle.
p294_365|Such debate is pointless.
p294_212|I have no secrets.
p251_094|If you could find it.
p376_062|Michael, he is running!
p294_134|I have had a wonderful career.
p294_242|That is however, the only part of the story.
p295_030|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p294_183|It was a big departure.
p294_177|I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.
p294_165|There was no change in the strategy.
p294_038|Their ambition is to go back.
p294_138|Above all, the approach is upbeat.
p294_048|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p294_169|I enjoy my work.
p294_176|You have to go to the edges.
p330_380|Debate is not just talk.
p323_334|It was not known to myself.
p361_091|Where are they?
p294_232|I'm not a little girl.
p294_419|We have every respect for Michelle.
p294_260|I haven't a clue.
p294_147|She was always a quality act.
p361_146|I want my mum.
p294_067|I fell in love with it right away.
p323_154|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p294_214|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p294_239|Do it for us now.
p294_288|A great deal was achieved.
p294_191|It is becoming a bit of a habit.
p294_093|But now it's back to golf.
p294_035|A neighbour said the street was shocked.
p294_071|It took about five or six hours.
p343_259|I'm not going to change from it.
p294_199|That's been the case for a while.
p294_101|It's annoying in a way.
p294_097|In fact, they go hand in hand.
p294_225|Gas is too expensive.
p225_346|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p294_321|We know we have done wrong.
p240_105|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p294_019|Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p294_277|From there, it was a success story.
p294_316|We all make mistakes.
p294_308|The appeal is impartial.
p294_376|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p323_194|You could see he was thinking about it.
p294_114|The industry will try to get round it.
p323_036|It is misleading to compare the two.
p294_068|Domestic abuse is related to power and control.
p294_312|However, it seems that he got it wrong.
p294_293|That case has still not been settled.
p257_400|I am the Son of Sam.
p363_166|My father and mother are.
p294_380|Visitors were also impressed.
p294_182|A decision is expected in September.
p294_287|This could take a few days.
p294_307|Cinema is a communal experience.
p295_031|Which is where the manager comes in.
p336_331|That's not part of the deal.
p294_100|You should have let it write the cards.
p294_418|Or, rather, it isn't.
p294_372|But opponents were quick to criticise.
p294_204|They should not be blamed for it.
p239_325|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p294_406|It was very well received.
p294_252|His director of football is leaving.
p236_496|They never gave up hope.
p294_149|I'm sure that is not.
p362_275|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p294_111|We have great confidence in Derek.
p294_121|We don't know what happened after.
p330_217|Are there muscular problems?
p294_305|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
p294_112|My ambition is to tell a good story.
p294_211|I love this job.
p294_197|He said nothing to waiting journalists.
p294_113|I don't know the nature of the illness.
p294_310|He added, We are full of anger.
p294_049|We've all done it!
p294_357|He completely loses control.
p294_386|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
p294_416|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p294_417|I saw it in a different way.
p294_323|I wanted to drop out.
p294_190|Its role is not to interfere.
p293_189|It's a huge amount.
p294_332|The need for further investment is obvious.
p294_247|Everything else is the same.
p294_227|Are we going mainstream?
p294_081|They could not have done more for me.
p294_384|We had our chances.
p294_367|Cooking is intricate and complex.
p294_362|Europe is a bonus.
p294_400|Of course, it doesn't all come off.
p294_175|Family members are at her bedside.
p362_345|The support of Britain is assumed.
p293_398|Their bid was a very good one.
p294_139|The objective was achieved.
p294_304|Could it have been better spent?
p323_319|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
p294_129|They were married in Edinburgh last summer.
p294_066|What kind of inclusion is that?
p294_262|I thought he was terrific.
p341_166|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p294_318|Now they have found out the truth.
p238_061|We work for the athlete.
p294_264|It possibly depends on the position.
p294_369|But it would change the context.
p294_217|It's not a question of talking.
p333_256|We started from scratch.
p294_178|Harry will be up for it.
p294_209|And do you know, it just wasn't the same.
p294_292|This could also affect the sentencing.
p294_084|It is a very genuine prospect.
p301_062|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p294_115|Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
p294_198|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
p294_159|You've been working for four years.
p294_166|There's been a mistake.
p294_144|It is a question of life and death.
p294_025|They were the better team on the night.
p294_095|Was it a signal?
p294_255|There are still some matters to be discussed.
p294_395|The council's concern is very simple.
p294_098|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p323_301|However, many questions remained unanswered.
p363_365|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p293_229|They will form a tribute.
p294_205|Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
p294_150|It's a great idea.
p294_104|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p361_126|He has gone through the process before.
p294_090|He had just returned from a run.
p294_311|They have nowhere else to go.
p294_179|He could tell you.
p336_089|But who was driving it?
p294_233|We have seen the future, and it is different.
p294_331|I'm so happy that she did.
p294_230|Who will run the bigger show?
p293_135|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
p294_342|She is an imposing presence.
p294_351|That was the type of man he was.
p323_250|So far he has not done so.
p294_228|I could not believe what they were saying.
p294_341|Anything can happen - at any moment.
p294_289|So it was sad.
p294_317|It didn't put me off.
p299_338|We will work through the night.
p294_194|You can't get a mortgage.
p294_338|No-one else was hurt.
p294_379|He edited the press release.
p294_274|It's as simple as that.
p294_405|It's a tragedy for the area.
p287_386|It was like a vacuum.
p294_201|All options are on the table.
p294_117|And she got it.
p294_240|We got the guarantee.
p294_399|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p294_333|Iraq has no interest in war.
p294_140|It was a hugely popular decision.
p294_324|I told you so.
p294_327|Is that what people we want?
p362_163|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p294_328|There are so many unanswered questions.
p294_203|We now have a moment of hope.
p363_264|It's an hour of the same response.
p294_041|I've been dying for an hour.
p294_295|They've got a mountain to climb.
p293_366|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p330_033|And it had two seats.
p294_040|My view has now changed completely.
p294_137|It was different in the endurance events.
p323_348|The auction will be held tomorrow.
p323_354|He died at the hands of his captors.
p294_156|We are well insured.
p323_245|There were no violations.
p294_263|A statement is expected in April.
p236_500|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p336_036|I want to make a vigorous defence.
p294_354|We didn't mean to kill him.
p294_334|It's hard, but we have had so much to do.
p294_254|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p294_132|I'm deeply sorry they did.
p317_290|They are in care for a reason.
p294_164|He also admitted.
p294_060|I went with the mood.
p294_224|It should be a pretty exciting session.
p376_164|I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
p294_072|I found the course inspiring.
p294_037|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
p293_378|It is three years at present.
p293_144|The Treasury denied the claims.
p294_236|I just have to accept that.
p294_368|He found it very hard to understand.
p294_407|I don't think there's going to be one.
p294_135|It seemed to have direction.
p294_058|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
p295_087|I don't entirely buy that.
p294_414|Would it really be good to shorten it?
p323_146|Boy is the town a mess.
p294_267|I would love to travel with it.
p294_290|It's a blunt instrument anyway.
p294_210|This came as no great surprise to anyone.
p294_171|We have a genuine budget in place.
p294_109|That was the context of his remarks.
p294_125|We have very real concerns about it.
p294_219|Then they killed another three.
p294_181|He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.
p294_303|And this tournament will travel.
p314_202|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p294_250|There are no excuses left for us.
p294_272|For now, they have gone as far as they can.
p294_047|This was no accident.
p294_278|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p294_302|Everything is so commercial.
p294_266|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p294_285|He had asked if they had the script.
p294_388|But what is?
p294_059|We are only human.
p294_027|It means we have to have some patience.
p294_089|Seven British members of the club are missing.
p294_186|The fire was falling from the sky.
p294_269|It is a common condition in children.
p294_329|Then it was into a series of classes.
p300_371|This takes the pressure off.
p247_377|Two things were clear from the new programme.
p294_152|It's a wonderful piece of water.
p294_296|It just would not work.
p294_347|It's just not our biggest problem.
p294_088|It's not very pretty, but it's effective.
p294_265|This will have no effect on the championship.
p294_343|There are moments of joy in politics.
p294_188|This is simply unjust.
p294_363|It is also used to buy coffins.
p294_245|Some days are different from others.
p294_216|We're very, very excited.
p267_202|It is an impressive record.
p294_409|Such is the ego involved.
p294_208|This club is perfect for me.
p294_161|There is no shortage of commitment.
p294_306|The order went out.
p294_330|He wants to play in the Champions League.
p299_269|I hope my successor will do the same.
p305_369|Now there is an even bigger target.
p299_222|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p317_288|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p341_220|I just could not cope.
p305_297|This is a very positive step forward.
p299_229|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p305_222|Then one night only three people turn up.
p239_269|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p305_075|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p305_305|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p299_097|He is a man who lives to work.
p299_083|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p317_178|A lot of things can go wrong.
p317_282|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p305_345|I didn't have a trio.
p305_130|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p299_039|I think we have a very strong case.
p305_176|That has given me great confidence.
p341_270|I'm just doing artwork.
p305_311|We've got a great defensive club.
p376_238|Israel has done very little until now.
p245_290|This is a huge confidence boost.
p305_386|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p305_047|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p317_270|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p376_395|This must have been severe.
p299_188|It worked, up to a point.
p305_098|Are they control freaks?
p305_071|Nancy is not sure how she feels.
p305_381|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
p364_180|Our children are our future.
p305_278|Yet he chose to do something different.
p299_396|I'll take what comes along.
p305_180|So he is open to ideas.
p317_379|It's a hidden problem.
p305_410|He has never even been to Ireland.
p254_401|It really is a gift to the world.
p317_301|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p305_203|I think it was briefly considered.
p299_214|Here are some possible solutions.
p305_262|I don't think it could be clearer.
p341_257|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p341_082|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p341_400|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p305_139|They do the work, you know.
p317_325|I am not even thinking about that.
p341_292|The whole team was rubbish.
p305_370|There has been a big change in defence.
p299_037|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p305_128|Who is the employer?
p305_193|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p341_207|She told me to apply for the crest.
p305_100|They never looked like winning it either.
p257_420|One must hope not!
p305_054|We see little sign of improvement.
p299_255|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p305_084|This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.
p341_124|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p317_037|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p317_292|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p305_319|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p299_274|We have got a full house tonight.
p305_153|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p341_203|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p364_026|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p305_127|How do you respond to losing your child?
p317_125|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p299_177|His signature is his handwriting.
p333_028|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p305_342|And we still have to pay his salary.
p305_050|But don't expect an easy ride.
p341_343|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p305_392|The love affair was over.
p376_408|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p299_130|They really did a great job.
p305_343|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p305_354|It was a long process, but we got there.
p341_062|They were not doing it too well, either.
p341_318|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p341_093|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p317_396|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p305_326|He made so many bad decisions.
p305_320|We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
p317_271|We have all been shocked by her death.
p305_147|They were even being used by primary pupils.
p317_409|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p341_196|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p305_233|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p341_410|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p305_210|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p305_290|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p341_274|So there's a double whammy.
s5_258|I've had to take time off work today.
p305_080|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
p305_366|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p317_372|It broke up my marriage.
p376_246|We certainly will need to watch him.
p333_396|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p299_146|There is too much at stake for that.
p305_412|Such people do not exist.
p305_359|They feel it belongs to them.
p364_289|We suspect he was pleased.
p317_219|Thus far we have received no complaints.
p299_397|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p341_356|She had every right to read the warrant.
p305_083|However, it is much bigger than that.
p305_406|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p341_307|The Dow Jones is way up.
p305_214|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
p305_252|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p317_257|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p305_253|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p317_069|How do you resurrect a dying town?
p305_310|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p305_230|Everything was up for grabs.
p305_170|I got off to a great start.
p317_330|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
p305_312|It's up to their parents to choose.
p317_104|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p305_055|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p305_271|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p299_072|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p317_254|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
p323_180|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p305_122|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p323_339|Angola was a really hard place.
p376_094|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p305_316|It is still holding good today.
p376_191|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p305_355|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p305_390|The package has been properly costed.
p305_132|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p305_183|We are expected to do better than before.
p299_144|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p305_227|There have been a lot of lessons learned.
p305_076|I'm so proud of my team.
p364_290|I have been here for only three months.
p341_057|So the process was refined.
p317_320|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p305_125|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p317_311|He was lying face down in the water.
p299_382|We believe the squad will stay together.
p317_274|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
p341_211|I think the Government should pay for that.
p305_395|I can't stop people thinking.
p317_221|Other people also tried.
p305_363|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p317_159|She is a double victim.
p299_198|I feel privileged to be here.
p305_213|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p305_407|See it while you can.
p299_219|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p317_042|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p305_104|It was a wilful act of violence.
p305_148|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p299_098|The website is now being amended.
p305_103|It is understood they saw one body.
p299_309|I thought he was part of the camera.
p305_201|The actors just have to say so.
p317_321|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
p317_113|The company has other problems with the shells.
p305_093|You've got it coming Kabul.
p305_068|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p299_170|She is a very lucky lady.
p305_219|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p305_303|They made a huge impression on me.
p305_388|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p233_332|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p376_221|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p305_174|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
p268_196|Everyone around the club was supportive.
p317_121|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p305_256|But there was a shift.
p305_263|We can only go up.
p305_331|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p299_070|They had had time for little else.
p305_091|This is not a recipe for conflict.
p299_364|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p305_348|I am astonished by this decision.
p341_398|We've still got a say in this.
p299_286|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p330_326|They were at her bedside when she died.
p305_097|My grandparents were terrified.
p317_084|This has not, and has been neglected.
p376_391|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
p317_056|That tells you something about them.
p299_115|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p305_043|He stands on Centre Court alone.
p305_155|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p299_350|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p305_092|He had done his homework properly.
p341_286|The fans will support us.
p305_403|It is not an abortion.
p305_165|We have already begun to do that here.
p254_255|It's a source of deep concern.
p299_388|She always wanted her own way.
p305_275|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p341_363|The place became a war zone.
p299_305|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p330_384|So people will come out with these things.
p305_408|I didn't do too badly myself.
p341_111|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p317_050|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p305_352|We will see how he is.
p299_266|Their three other children had died as infants.
p341_136|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p305_232|There will not be any charges.
p341_185|We've been there for seven years.
p305_380|He was released in March this year.
p317_360|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p299_159|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p305_049|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p305_175|I got on very well with Allan.
p305_378|Injury has played a part, but not a big one.
p317_035|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p305_135|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p299_220|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p343_056|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p299_082|I still feel like a wee boy.
p305_404|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p376_350|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p299_049|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p305_167|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p317_093|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p305_064|This rule is archaic.
p305_384|People might not actually want the job.
p305_240|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p299_064|How could anyone take issue with that?
p333_207|We didn't know he was even out.
p317_240|For example they could be in school uniform.
p305_400|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p305_063|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p305_110|Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
p317_102|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p299_402|Women reported more depression than men.
p317_253|They just made me feel dizzy.
p314_285|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p305_129|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
p317_206|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p305_158|We are asking the council to think again.
p268_321|It gave me something to focus on.
p299_167|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p317_211|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p305_133|You can never have enough money.
p305_391|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p341_165|Most of the public are behind me.
p305_375|We're all in a state of shock.
p317_172|Each day is a new beginning.
p305_237|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p376_382|They too refused to come out and talk.
p317_058|I am a drug addict.
p317_317|He urged people to forgive.
p317_152|T, Is there anything in the wound?
p305_398|Several people were out in the street.
p343_116|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p313_267|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p343_237|It's really good fun.
p343_327|Everyone believes in it.
p313_298|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p343_176|He will want to utilise the midfield.
p343_091|It's terrible that this is happening.
p374_408|That was never their agenda.
p343_096|The winner will be announced next month.
p343_283|It may take time to get it back.
p343_066|This happened on three days inside a week.
p343_387|Because it's a secret.
p343_271|I knew people on that committee.
p343_337|That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
p295_124|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p293_083|However, my position remains the same.
p343_232|She has not returned to work.
p313_403|It would have been very easily done.
p343_112|I would love to play in Europe again.
p343_338|He didn't let me down.
p343_040|And you know something?
p343_257|Horses are not affected.
p343_038|We are a team of hard workers.
p343_117|He also has property interests in the country.
p343_180|The talking cannot go on too long.
p313_352|Two others were also seriously injured.
p343_029|It is a crucial award.
p343_209|Children also died in Britain.
p343_374|He is lying to save his skin.
p343_095|And so it goes on.
p343_304|Is it the flight?
p343_108|I've got to get noticed!
p343_188|It was good today.
p343_334|It is my last chance.
p343_064|He has really done well.
p293_149|We had to take action to protect them.
p295_126|You have a very persuasive president.
p343_186|If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
p313_270|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p343_303|It is a real concern.
p343_270|That is a question for the next manager.
p343_059|I don't believe in gesture politics.
p343_110|It's up to them to decide.
p343_321|What on earth is happening to rugby?
p313_284|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p295_037|He must not be removed from office.
p343_048|He is trying really hard.
p343_141|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p343_347|That will just be the beginning.
p343_027|We will be back next year.
p343_175|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
p343_079|I am looking forward to getting home.
p343_078|They were at school together.
p343_163|The latter way is my way.
p343_197|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p343_262|He knows the course.
p343_050|It is a beautiful country.
p343_143|He had finally had enough.
p343_098|I am not a fan of books.
p343_241|We did not complete the process.
p343_207|He is helping police with their inquiries.
p343_215|The hearing was fair.
p343_376|He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
p343_224|She is currently in foster care.
p343_158|It is a traffic warden.
p343_148|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p343_193|Is that not uncanny?
p343_229|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p343_044|I had troubles with the producers.
p343_192|It has been a magical moment.
p343_369|The warning was lifted late last night.
p343_185|Of course, there was still much to be done.
p313_416|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p343_174|That began as an accident.
p343_214|He said he would appeal the sentences.
p343_102|I am not a doctor.
p343_025|I've got a long way to go.
p343_217|This was not a summit about the euro.
p343_323|It is so out of character.
p343_298|It's the whole package.
p343_274|There was no argument.
p343_144|But not all were so defiant.
p343_060|The decision is purely down to the clinic.
p343_250|Actually, nothing much will change.
p343_033|Nor is it likely to do so.
p343_100|Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
p343_307|Scotland doesn't even have a target.
p343_053|This was never a support group.
p343_248|He had a great game.
p343_145|We are not going to get carried away.
p343_324|Otherwise we would all pay the price.
p343_152|It always had to be about the gym.
p340_076|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p343_234|He is the saviour of South Africa.
p343_400|I love the feel of the place.
p343_366|Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
p343_326|It is time, he said.
p239_304|That should give me a chance.
p343_036|I go in for the parts.
p343_349|That had not happened on this occasion.
p300_138|We were with him the whole time.
p343_146|I told that to the police.
p343_220|I didn't actually work up a speech.
p343_286|The answer is yes.
p343_256|It was totally out of the blue.
p343_069|It was just awful.
p313_345|Staff have been informed.
p343_219|He saw it all as a big game.
p343_201|He said to give a local injection.
p343_199|Or so it is hoped.
p343_103|It is all in the mind.
p343_322|It is now being examined.
p307_114|He took away my childhood.
p343_094|It is par for the course, of course.
p343_226|They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p343_348|No one can say that about me.
p343_246|He died later in hospital.
p313_418|Would they work together again?
p343_109|Not that it was needed.
p343_356|It comes down to the police in England.
p286_233|These things have not happened by accident.
p343_088|I will report in the spring.
p343_392|It just isn't a defining issue for them.
p343_253|There were too many mistakes.
p343_381|It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
p343_313|The children continue to talk to us.
p343_135|It's about doing things.
p343_065|I'm just delighted to take it.
p343_218|If he leaves, the band is finished.
p343_171|It has been handled entirely properly.
p343_372|And if he hasn't become a musician?
p343_235|The players are obviously keen to do well.
p343_203|Entries from the event are still being accepted.
p343_039|It is up to Ann.
p343_111|But we can't have a casino.
p343_287|I believe in debate and dialogue.
p343_345|So you let me know.
p343_236|Men should avoid it like the plague.
p343_223|But he kept on repeating it.
p343_196|These days are over.
p343_364|There's a hint of classical.
p343_210|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p343_312|It was not a cover-up.
p343_119|The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
p343_134|I haven't been able to do it since.
p343_087|No one was listening.
p313_369|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p343_191|That tells you something.
p343_268|We are all suffering.
p343_179|This has been very frustrating for him.
p343_147|On the other hand, the poster did not help.
p343_202|This is an internal matter.
p343_184|Footage has been passed on to the police.
p313_378|That's the only thing that matters.
p343_159|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p343_309|A compromise is essential.
p361_261|What can you do?
p343_084|I didn't understand it.
p343_183|But experience is a wonderful thing.
p343_294|He had a decision to make.
p343_131|The answer is maybe.
p374_335|And we have beaten them before.
p343_028|I was very, very pleased with our display.
p343_170|Do they have to create seven majors?
p313_359|The hotel was huge.
p313_324|The referee had a shocking game.
p343_043|We've all been here before.
p343_371|I have to take some of the blame.
p343_370|There is always the smell.
p343_073|I am ready to go.
p374_284|People don't feel safe, including me.
p313_385|We could learn a lot from them.
p292_410|I am looking forward to this film.
p343_169|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p343_076|We are at the crossroads.
p343_331|He was a one off.
p343_019|Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p343_127|We are not with you.
p343_157|I can't believe the buzz.
p343_167|Are his works inside out?
p343_276|She is a valuable member of Government.
p343_121|This decision is destroying my family.
p343_395|Each one is as good as the other.
p343_165|It is one of those things.
p343_120|I cannot believe this decision.
p343_260|And they are different.
p343_300|This has got to stop.
p343_082|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p313_355|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p343_037|It should be the reverse.
p313_280|One thing is sure.
p343_398|There is no formula.
p343_254|He says it often enough.
p343_308|They really shouldn't have put it out.
p343_344|They will be up for it for sure.
p343_385|It almost certainly is.
p343_279|We are talking about one family.
p343_136|For a few years we had good fun.
p343_355|We will need to look at that.
p268_296|They need to be involved.
p295_335|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
p238_277|He is not a pathetic figure.
p343_092|He's got the same story.
p343_282|Everything is so new.
p343_291|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
p343_182|I hope that that will be forthcoming.
p343_155|They've been wonderful to me.
p343_205|That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
p313_315|The odds are that it will.
p295_131|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
p343_302|There is no point of looking any further.
p374_035|We are expecting a big crowd.
p343_124|We reckon we can do very well.
p343_238|Our positions remains unchanged.
p343_343|It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
p343_126|It has been a great day.
p343_097|What was this?
p343_049|I have no doubt about that.
p343_150|I'm going to win the gold.
p343_140|That was a good effort.
p343_264|There is no room for error.
p343_249|It's still got that at its heart.
p343_020|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p343_258|It went on forever.
p343_227|The service will only survive with change.
p343_275|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p343_093|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p343_026|I'll go to the races.
p343_107|I am not a paedophile.
p343_161|That never came to court as a charge.
p343_383|And there is another problem.
p343_342|The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
p343_149|But when we do it it is great.
p343_325|Our thoughts are with her.
p343_320|Green is desperate to play on The Open.
p343_384|That is the theory.
p343_074|We are still suffering from that.
p292_119|I was influenced by all of these things.
p280_400|There were no hard words between us.
p280_410|At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
s5_282|It had happened on average once a week this year.
p280_124|In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
p280_307|It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.
s5_369|These old songs are very nice to play.
p280_401|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
p280_285|There was just fire all around me.
s5_350|My views on the decision are well known.
p280_351|I think we are back on track.
p280_406|We were on top and could have won.
p280_402|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
p280_409|The play was to go straight ahead.
p252_091|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p280_399|I think it's a big advantage to us.
p280_407|Some would say that that culture had been created already.
p280_408|So it looks like a done deal.
p268_120|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p274_250|He would not impose a fine.
p274_333|The group is not paying a dividend.
p230_376|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p333_297|And sooner than we may think.
p259_161|We have to speed up the process.
p247_249|Others agreed with this view.
p247_457|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.
p287_239|The effects are not all bad.
p274_137|It's going to take some time.
p274_467|The answer was up there on the stage.
p259_478|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
p274_345|Our season is not finished.
p336_271|I've had a wonderful career.
p274_362|We are in a global market.
p274_451|It could cause a little bit of disruption.
p274_108|Here the jury is still out.
p252_317|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p273_433|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p274_155|The danger is always there.
p273_089|It was a family tragedy.
p259_343|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p259_421|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p274_168|It's not good at all.
p274_095|It is for policy Ministers to defend their policies.
p247_047|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p274_347|The business model is actually very exciting.
p259_359|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p274_418|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p274_242|It will now be revived.
p239_151|Which isn't a bad idea.
p286_134|It was a good game to watch.
p274_385|It will be completed within a year.
p274_469|He will not be involved in school discipline.
p274_459|Now that business is banned.
p287_370|The members have voted against it.
p274_314|His appeal is instantly understood.
p274_188|The interim dividend has been passed.
p230_415|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p274_025|I can't play the game for them.
p363_422|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
p274_120|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
p274_051|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
p274_186|They responded well after the run of defeats.
p274_299|It is a flexible concept.
p295_305|Nobody will be forced to work.
p259_249|It's easy to be negative about these things.
p274_287|It has raised the profile of Scottish banking.
p274_462|Driving has been the key.
p274_332|But I have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again.
p274_439|His message was very simple.
p286_414|It's just a training thing.
p230_333|After some discussion they did.
p274_102|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p274_044|People want to see me on the screen.
p274_388|The group will also become an Internet service provider.
p259_463|Quality was high in all sections.
p274_284|My main intention was to write a funny comedy.
p286_049|We are certainly talking about many millions.
p274_358|Governments will have to respond.
p252_378|The referee faces a massive job.
p247_318|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.
p247_277|He is quite well organised.
p274_159|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p274_060|He hadn't had them for a long time.
p274_374|It had been a magical moment.
p286_433|There is another important factor.
p274_394|The board meetings will be held in Edinburgh.
p273_264|This will look at consumer attitudes.
p274_081|It took an option on the process.
p274_344|No one wants a dispute.
p376_125|And we were very lucky.
p274_134|This is a major championship.
p259_342|This will save interest charges.
p274_425|The projections are very positive for South Africa.
p340_110|That's the way it goes.
p274_052|The latter were not from Scotland.
p274_079|It is the only company of its kind in the UK.
p300_056|It comes on like a tidal wave.
p306_049|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p317_231|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p306_037|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p300_098|There are a huge number of arts.
p300_286|The law will take its course.
p306_069|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p300_108|You either have him or you don't.
p336_055|We said, What do you mean?
p306_057|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
p317_298|Was all this really just five months ago?
p300_176|It is very difficult to find a buyer.
p300_051|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p300_107|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p306_164|I do my job.
p300_323|I don't know what he was capable of.
p340_237|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p300_034|Blood samples have been taken.
p300_029|Of course, this is nice to hear.
p300_381|Who is going to pay their wages?
p300_192|These elements are not in the book.
p300_210|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
p306_116|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p300_135|However, details have yet to be worked out.
p300_150|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
p300_028|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
p299_331|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p300_392|I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact.
p300_379|They should have some measure of protection.
p306_129|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
p300_053|Retirement, who knows?
p306_146|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
p300_281|This is a great shame.
p306_046|We will continue to operate within the sport.
p300_059|He was taken ill in December last year.
p300_343|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p300_066|He also does not get along with Christina.
p300_175|You cannot eat in the dining room.
p300_081|His options are severely limited.
p306_076|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
p306_156|This is a foolish idea.
p306_202|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
p300_048|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
p300_391|Form and structure are his music.
p300_096|He told us about it the next day.
p300_206|It is turning that way all across Europe.
p300_052|It's a grey area.
s5_062|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p306_231|We have tried to keep his head up.
p306_121|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p300_137|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
p300_311|An aide was constructed to get a copy.
p300_027|It is not an amnesty.
p300_166|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
p300_086|I have made good progress.
p300_063|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p306_354|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p300_325|It's good to start with Judith.
p300_369|I am really looking forward to it.
p300_082|This is truly field of miracles.
p300_161|You should be there with six different characters.
p306_073|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
p300_306|Their message was simple.
p300_157|You might even have seen him.
p300_075|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
p306_113|Look at them after three days of rain.
p306_213|It is like being a qualifier again.
p376_075|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p300_169|Who do these people think they are?
p306_254|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
p306_106|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p306_123|This is not understood by people outside.
p300_149|I feel my life to be at risk.
p306_122|I will speak to Michael about this.
p300_099|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p300_062|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p255_328|We agreed to disagree.
p300_115|There is no point in pushing it.
p306_201|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
p306_197|We have only nine months to go.
p300_183|This one was my best chance.
p306_035|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
p300_398|We expect to come through on Thursday.
p300_026|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
p306_295|People will make up their own minds.
p300_072|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
p300_105|People just came on their own.
p300_089|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
p300_393|Is the Welsh assembly going to go?
p300_143|He's been the key to everything.
p300_084|Why did they let him go?
p306_109|There are some new buildings in there.
p300_036|He said he now intends to fly today.
p362_053|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p306_355|I didn't even have the first idea.
p306_186|A bit of match fitness is required.
p300_087|We do need a new one.
p300_093|But the relief was short-lived.
p306_141|That's because we work hard at it.
p300_040|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
p300_127|I went straight to the toilet.
p300_212|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p300_366|And here is the rub.
p300_399|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p306_261|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p300_181|This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p300_058|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.
p306_031|I don't believe you own anything.
p300_342|What kind of person is he?
p306_337|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p300_077|You'd think there was a match on today.
p300_351|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p306_030|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
p306_198|Both of them have looked good.
p306_335|I believe he can do a better job.
p306_068|How things have changed since then.
p300_132|I've always been desperate to play this part.
p300_091|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
s5_211|I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
p306_182|She is living proof of their expertise.
p300_085|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
p300_144|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
p300_167|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
p306_112|There is great relief at this point.
p300_120|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p306_039|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p300_394|The award was a lifeline for me.
p300_151|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
p306_269|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
p239_061|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p300_396|For all his successes, he is accustomed to waiting for fulfilment.
p306_128|She says the royal family get on well.
p300_385|That's the kind of thing that counts.
p300_386|Construction would then begin.
p306_204|Donald was a man with many friends.
p300_273|The board has rejected her proposals.
p300_373|I will never get over his death.
p300_226|I found a fault and it worked at it.
p300_199|I like footballers who play well.
p306_103|Housing is in very short supply.
p330_290|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p306_038|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p300_330|She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p306_071|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
p306_158|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
p306_193|You look at them and you understand.
p300_288|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p300_352|Who has the second highest?
p376_289|Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
p306_111|I'm not a diva.
p306_080|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p300_208|We were on top and could've won.
p330_247|They are also exploited by the markets.
p300_326|She is now on the back benches.
p300_134|There is still much work to be done.
p300_187|All were paid by the taxpayer.
p300_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.
p300_363|This is not great, but it goes well.
p300_177|It shows that we are civilised society.
p300_217|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
p300_260|He must have something up his sleeve.
p300_153|We need some confidence to get a win.
p306_160|She collapsed and died a day later.
p255_370|They received a reply from their own managers.
p226_274|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p226_270|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p238_315|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p269_357|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p226_267|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p233_141|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
p267_099|We need to handle it.
p233_201|He may need it.
p233_327|It added to the spectacle.
p226_340|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p233_369|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p233_340|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p269_246|I know I'm in a very special position.
p233_321|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p233_144|I saw some terrible things.
p233_351|He agreed with my proposal.
p254_362|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p295_375|There is no point in looking any further.
p269_070|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p251_163|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p257_329|We must do something.
p255_141|We have got to get it right.
p253_267|One knows the feeling.
p257_275|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p257_121|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p254_190|Off I went.
p257_390|There was no trouble.
p245_208|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p240_326|It is out there.
p257_232|John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
p257_122|He did his job.
p255_216|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p257_356|He knew his job inside out.
p241_357|Our numbers are small.
p257_430|The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
p240_134|It is also well received.
p257_419|It's not about defining styles.
p257_293|It's just not funny!
p257_401|She is superb.
p240_061|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p232_398|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p232_414|I was very young.
p226_174|It's quite a routine.
p257_347|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p240_092|She told The Herald.
p251_351|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p232_415|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p257_396|You wanted the evidence.
p257_402|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
p257_413|We are delighted with this outcome.
p257_375|It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
p232_313|I never thought it would take this long.
p226_131|I was furious.
p257_405|No preference emerged.
p257_360|I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
p317_072|This is not an optional extra.
p317_111|This is the big one.
p363_293|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
p317_041|Overall, however, these were also down.
p376_417|It is essential that we win the game.
p317_040|The gaffer was great.
p317_151|The driver escaped injury.
p317_346|A decision is expected next March.
p317_318|In fact, it might just be beginning.
p307_190|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p317_055|New potential dangers were emerging.
p317_299|Some reports said they had been killed.
p317_371|I am so lucky for that.
p317_327|The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
p317_189|This makes no sense!
p317_280|It was always open for extension.
p317_395|It's a long-term solution.
p317_295|I keep my fingers crossed.
p376_193|We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
p317_064|They say he wants to go to England.
p317_212|It's a production company.
p317_054|I am going home to see my children.
p292_037|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p317_375|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p317_184|The police were called in.
p317_160|How can you not react?
p317_098|Too much has already been said.
p317_234|That's the whole idea.
p317_145|A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.
p317_140|Actors stand still in the frame.
p295_381|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
p295_276|Manchester United are the classic example.
p317_289|It's so creative and different.
p255_171|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p273_330|They will have to cut through the roof.
p317_192|He said that this is beautiful.
p317_124|There was no confusion over the second.
p317_378|We talk to each other about these matters.
p317_186|Aye, but who do you really support?
p317_278|The bookies have got it about right.
p317_315|They didn't have a care in the world.
p317_268|Here the National Gallery has been very clever.
p317_411|This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
p239_500|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p364_198|You would be wrong.
p317_070|And what does it cost, and who is paying?
p317_381|There will be two other areas of contention.
p317_089|This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.
p317_225|I can't deny that fact.
p317_147|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
p317_285|He also has a house in Italy.
p317_342|They were average apart, together superb.
p317_122|Our home is your home.
p317_405|And our game is about going forward.
p317_185|The group would never be the same again.
p317_100|But don't worry just yet.
p317_135|It is important that vital services are maintained.
p317_029|I am not a fan of stoppages.
p317_074|We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.
p317_171|This is excellent value for money.
p317_322|There is no right to appeal.
p317_131|Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
p317_065|They are the partner of choice for anyone.
p317_136|These services may also have to be cut.
p317_355|What's a boy to do?
p317_241|Surely the panel was interested?
p317_248|This is a huge event.
p317_181|I'll just do my best.
p376_120|I shouldn't have to put up with it.
p293_223|We never got off the bus.
p317_082|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p317_357|The other was the tabloids.
p317_060|The problem is the book.
p317_126|A decision is expected shortly.
p317_269|Do you want a cup of tea.
p267_192|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p317_194|That option cannot be ruled out.
p317_284|And that is not a bad idea.
p317_326|Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.
p317_348|I am awaiting a reply.
p317_139|We can't have it both ways.
p317_073|This is not the most crucial issue.
p317_265|Whatever happened to that one?
p317_237|My life is a mess.
p301_344|We were lucky to have survived.
p317_208|Would he be able to live with that?
p301_151|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p317_349|There was no need for such a hostel.
p295_262|The committees are due to report next year.
p317_116|Then, as we know too well, anything can happen.
p317_337|I was not a joiner.
p363_138|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p317_328|It is good for their eyesight.
p317_264|It will be an eye for an eye.
p317_377|And Rangers think they have problems.
p317_176|Thereafter he left Scotland.
p317_352|There's no doubt about it.
p317_048|As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
p317_179|I was delighted with Robbie.
p317_335|It's not that difficult, it really isn't.
p317_222|But Harry has become a franchise.
p295_157|We must get the three points.
p317_303|It is like a bereavement.
p313_049|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p247_359|He said something in his work.
p247_380|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.
p267_298|It is inherent in society.
p247_134|But it could be a consequence of our policy.
p286_445|There were no formal announcements.
p247_425|It was submitted without their knowledge.
p259_111|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
p287_226|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p246_041|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p247_454|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p247_430|The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.
p247_333|The people will not be patient.
p247_067|It came as a surprise.
p236_485|It happens on an annual basis.
p238_105|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
p239_338|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p363_292|It was an achievement all right.
p247_243|They have to be able to play the game.
p247_263|He has also cut a record.
p267_371|to have products for their needs.
p247_441|There is no hiding place.
p247_329|Investors can be forgiven for caution.
p247_314|Britain is going to celebrate in style.
p247_282|There were no problems with the crowds.
p268_102|You should try to have a laugh.
p247_034|The company did not declare a dividend.
p259_262|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.
p247_466|I think it's a great system.
p247_140|This is the highlight of my career.
p247_420|That is not the position of the British relatives.
p286_040|It is serious - but not that serious.
p247_303|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
p292_048|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p247_375|They have broken that promise.
p247_247|I am not going to go tomorrow.
p247_188|Talks are at an advanced stage.
p247_051|We would have concerns about suspension.
p236_400|It certainly appeared that way.
p259_151|His second goal was equally impressive.
p239_425|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p259_396|That is a crazy situation.
p247_046|It's not a swimming pool out there.
p247_428|A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.
p247_233|It will be strictly cross-country.
p247_456|Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.
p247_190|The Royal Highland was no exception.
p273_063|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
p247_122|However, the problem is timing.
p247_297|A revival is under way.
p273_258|It was a minor incident.
p247_298|They were worth the money.
p247_355|But the New Year was special.
p247_408|But they can also be managed by telephone.
p273_031|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p230_112|We have the mental strength.
p247_054|Italy is a beautiful place.
p247_473|We will now look into its historical background.
p259_380|He can handle it without any problem.
p247_391|He will consult the right people.
p247_464|I'm very passionate about my country.
p247_052|The couple actually came upon the accident.
p287_421|That's been all around Europe with me.
p272_148|The role of the law lords would be retained.
p277_426|The MoD has denied any cover-up.
p272_106|Our position remains unchanged.
p256_281|But I've won both ways.
p277_440|And it showed.
p277_454|Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
p288_385|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p272_046|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p364_140|It won the match.
p277_412|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p277_417|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
p277_221|Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
p277_045|He's just in it for himself.
p272_220|They must do it.
p340_391|The children are fine.
p293_220|Who would be in that desert?
p277_456|If they don't, they should say so.
p277_453|Stewart was the life and soul of the party.
p277_336|The performance was excellent.
p272_342|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p277_325|Well, it won't.
p277_324|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p277_450|It was a total disaster.
p277_318|I was invited to work in Germany.
p336_139|He is that good.
p336_213|Politics is a tough game.
p336_162|I hope he gets it.
p336_399|The pressure is enormous.
p336_226|The biggest resource is our staff.
p336_424|This is a matter of life and death.
p336_417|They want to prove a point.
p336_343|The work was suspended following the kidnap.
p336_250|That does not mean we have failed.
p336_086|There are no other contenders.
p336_184|It has been difficult for her to do, he says.
p336_049|It was a joy.
p336_047|There can be no dispute about our history.
p336_337|Wouldn't it be nice?
p336_093|When is it ever anything else?
p336_360|Its future is no longer in question.
p336_132|I just have no maternal instincts.
p293_217|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
p336_383|We are looking very hard at ourselves.
p336_079|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
p336_179|We've got a mixture of both.
p336_307|It is a daunting task.
p336_398|He put a lot of effort into it.
p336_042|I should say so.
p336_376|At this point we can only speculate.
p336_174|The support from the general public was astounding.
p336_210|More than that, it's a vicious circle.
p336_056|I have been there many times.
p336_033|We are proud of them.
p336_029|Are we not men?
p336_043|Yet therein is the problem.
p295_333|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
p336_081|The issues are not going to change.
p336_259|I'm happy that we have agreed.
p336_192|Don't hold your breath!
p336_273|I didn't expect to be in.
p336_044|This isn't a new problem.
p336_379|It may be the first of many.
p336_124|The whole thing was just unreal.
p336_101|That is unlikely to happen.
p336_404|But we say Yes - and we are the people.
p336_106|Don't you believe it.
p336_059|They enjoy playing the game.
p336_416|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p336_326|We have great support.
p336_348|He is very much respected within the group.
p293_091|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p336_318|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p336_334|They are very concerned, and you can understand that.
p336_401|Are you all right?
p336_077|We couldn't afford it.
p336_050|It's the same with cinema.
p336_349|People want to learn.
p336_389|I am not going to sit back.
p336_228|How will we get there?
p336_204|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p293_134|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
p336_085|I don't think it is.
p336_361|But this relative success has not been easy.
p336_030|How could it not?
p336_027|It is deeply worrying.
p336_415|The auction has seven days to run.
p336_025|I am very happy with the result.
p336_141|We need to be more specific.
p336_188|New Labour are running scared.
p336_061|It is not standing army.
p336_109|I want to keep playing.
p336_177|We have made mistakes and were badly punished.
p336_400|I am not that sadistic.
p336_120|It's almost certainly not going to help.
p336_178|The bombing has had a huge influence.
p336_324|I don't want to do too much.
p336_238|But we must work in harmony.
p336_325|We don't have money to get to town.
p336_358|Inside, there is a kind of madness.
p336_231|Cars are great for going long distances.
p336_117|He, too, is keen to redress the balance.
p336_214|I have friends in Glasgow.
p336_048|The crowd was waiting.
p336_411|His attacker has been a Rangers fan.
p336_287|I had no experience at all.
p336_403|I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
p336_306|This is a very special moment for me.
p336_366|Who wouldn't do it?
p336_249|I don't have any regrets about the edit.
p336_319|This is a problem we have to tackle.
p336_393|The truth is he probably doesn't.
p336_131|I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p336_096|Sub Not Used, Mackay.
p336_315|But he made a mistake in picking it.
p336_170|These days will be back.
p336_075|But we will learn from that.
p336_209|The claim was denied by the first minister.
p336_127|It's better than that, it's fantastic.
p336_237|These were the dreams.
p336_409|I just carry on with my work.
p336_295|Even then it might be difficult.
p336_040|It was pretty special.
p336_167|I can't do anything before nine.
p336_180|I'm very happy to be here.
p336_216|There's nothing to be gained by it.
p336_407|It would be that absurd.
p340_127|This is not the case.
p336_352|But it was fun.
p336_148|Then there is the Mini itself.
p336_171|However, they should not come as a surprise.
p336_291|It's a national sport.
p336_150|It's good for the city.
p336_347|She becomes a mother.
p336_380|It runs in cycles.
p336_142|This is the man who provides the hope.
p336_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.
p336_313|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p336_373|Further expansion is possible.
p362_369|We thought we were looking in good shape.
p336_340|It is a terrible thing to have happened.
p336_365|There was too much at stake.
p336_412|He wants the festival to make a difference.
p295_306|We're all going to take a holiday.
p336_394|There were few surprises.
p336_328|And it's difficult to argue.
p336_292|I just made it.
p336_066|Get used to it.
p336_114|We are getting there.
p336_121|Why does it come out now?
p336_304|They are not always the same person.
p336_418|It is my decision and my decision alone.
p336_140|We did not have a clue.
p293_028|All my training is for Athens.
p336_370|We are all in the frontline.
p336_382|I spoke to him yesterday.
p313_042|That, though, was just the start of it.
p336_390|But this is even worse.
p336_103|This is not finished.
p336_129|Everyone in front of me was dead.
p336_419|Would he ever go back to the beginning?
p336_165|I am here to work for Scottish Labour.
p336_322|No person has been charged.
p336_336|Was it too obvious?
p336_154|Because he usually is.
p336_270|Some injustice was committed.
p295_353|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p336_254|He has refused to do that.
p336_152|Controllers major concern is safety.
p336_104|It was one of the firemen.
p336_202|I've been enjoying it, though.
p336_064|The second is freedom.
p336_359|I'd like to run.
p336_285|The cause remained a mystery last night.
p336_195|Safety is our first concern.
p336_083|Would you have ever believed that was possible?
p336_041|Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.
p336_323|One paper was not returned.
p336_293|There was no secrecy.
p336_145|He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.
p336_031|It is sending the wrong message to people.
p336_316|This is an appealing record.
p336_112|That is how we will be judged.
p336_146|He was always nice to me.
p336_423|Tonight is very special.
p259_435|I watch the other visitors.
p336_362|I am a player.
p336_267|Not that it is unique.
p336_197|Inspections are not the problem.
p340_253|I am not a liar.
p336_090|We have to get this sorted out.
p336_087|On that they agree.
p336_327|One would not want to go there anyway.
p336_229|She told me to stop.
p336_032|Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.
p336_205|It's part of the end game.
p336_420|What is going on?
p336_206|Do they play for the money?
p336_038|IT is a terrible equation.
p336_385|We were beaten by the better team today.
p336_222|The warnings were a good reminder.
p336_405|Is it any good?
p336_172|It could last five months.
p336_288|Yet he remains confident enough.
p292_204|She made no further comment.
p336_092|Singing is my first love.
p336_375|I'm interested in all kinds of history.
p336_176|However, it does not tell the full story.
p336_136|It's very hard to plan for it.
p336_257|This is a personal decision for me.
p330_374|He wouldn't do it.
p336_115|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p336_377|We know we have the quality.
p336_364|He was not alone.
p336_233|The lads are having a tour.
p336_037|That incident altered the pattern of the game.
p336_260|All of them were killed.
p336_258|When will you listen?
p336_230|I wish him well for the future.
p336_196|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p336_275|I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
p336_240|There is no other way.
p336_303|It is three years.
p293_160|The only answer is a public inquiry.
p336_397|She is having an affair with his partner.
p293_158|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
p336_211|And how much of a compliment is that?
p336_175|About time too, you might think.
p336_173|Everything is accounted for.
p336_187|Cloning is not ready.
p336_218|We have been through this with the lawyers.
p336_219|I'm not interested in the job.
p336_126|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p336_182|This one was supposed to be so different.
p336_301|It was complete nonsense.
p336_332|There is a problem.
p336_408|As if he would.
p292_099|Life becomes a song.
p253_063|It happened so quickly.
p253_032|Help is needed.
p288_099|It was an adventure.
p253_065|It seems to have worked.
p253_096|He's been hit by it.
p253_074|It could take some time.
p255_247|It's quite a line-up!
p241_053|However the drama was still not at an end.
p240_364|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
p240_278|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
p293_224|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p240_106|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
p240_152|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p241_078|I've got the shirt.
p288_096|It was a good performance.
p240_288|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
p246_102|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p226_029|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p254_231|And thought we would get away with it.
p256_127|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p254_265|There is no link.
p240_111|It's a question of perception.
p240_097|He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
p240_249|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
p256_039|It's a real threat.
p269_207|I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.
p254_395|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p269_104|No date has been set for the appeal.
p269_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows.
p256_034|A web site is planned for November.
p269_092|The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
p269_392|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
p269_248|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p269_071|It's a winner.
p269_215|I began to pray.
p269_391|If you look at the other galleries in this area.
p254_175|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
p269_055|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p269_119|It was a delight on every level.
p232_260|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p269_154|It's like a football team.
p269_382|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p251_082|You will be.
p245_077|That is bound to happen.
p286_132|They will remember this victory for a while.
p286_161|Behind him was his brother.
p286_397|It gets into the culture.
p286_466|He was backed by Downing Street.
p286_325|They can go to no other method of fishing.
p239_333|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
p286_073|That would be too easy.
p286_418|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
p286_307|It was simply no contest.
p286_282|That will be a problem for later.
p267_253|His is a global perspective.
p363_301|It is a terrible state of affairs.
p238_107|Their mandate is to target inflation.
p230_315|I must do something about it.
p273_270|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
p286_436|But he gave no details.
p286_198|The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
p286_299|That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance.
p286_448|The couple had one daughter.
s5_090|It is a great feeling right now.
p286_188|We have a long way to go this week.
p286_447|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
p301_153|He was forced to quit.
p259_358|I didn't have the reply.
p286_167|It should never have happened.
p268_030|We must convince the citizens.
p286_129|The firm also has a construction division.
p286_320|He has taken the title for the last two years.
p259_129|Tiger is not the norm.
p286_450|We make this offer to the parliament.
p313_087|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p323_256|We are a new department.
p286_286|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
p287_310|You are a different people.
p286_446|He had no problems with discipline.
p286_464|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p286_434|The growth potential is enormous.
p286_449|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president Jim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
p286_467|It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated.
p286_432|They did the right thing.
p286_289|It wasn't about one player.
p286_226|Scotland will play its part.
p286_153|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
p286_192|They are only interested in attacking Labour.
p236_309|I am a retailer by nature.
p286_409|They were a lovely family.
p286_453|He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
p313_038|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
p313_321|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p313_205|So she told him.
p255_324|They will be destroyed.
p313_025|They will be dealt with.
p313_300|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
p374_151|They may differ on other issues.
p313_062|They said they were only young men.
p313_185|The United Nations must act.
p313_196|After that, though, we're still waiting to see.
p313_249|We should be rewarded for producing.
p313_142|It's typical of me.
p374_195|The stadium was full.
p363_395|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p313_095|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p313_364|I'm amazed at what he's done.
p313_296|Is being naturally funny enough?
p313_043|We are not moving in.
p313_310|And we've beaten them before.
p313_093|There's also the point.
p374_159|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p313_055|Her role in it was small.
p313_213|The squad will be the same for France.
p333_084|But will they fall in love?
p313_411|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p313_177|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p313_040|They hit me in the head.
p313_241|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p313_282|I'm confident we can do that.
p313_358|Closure is not one of them.
p376_114|But what are the songs about?
p313_334|She has nothing to say to journalists.
p313_379|I enjoy the creative process.
p313_286|We're talking about the outskirts of London.
p333_276|It's a way of making a mark.
p313_256|The reason is partly because of tradition.
p313_102|There was no trouble at all.
p313_186|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p313_349|It's been handled entirely properly.
p313_261|He was in contention almost every week.
p313_120|The Tory party will last.
p313_399|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p313_264|We are playing them at their own game.
p313_187|Her daughter is getting married.
p313_330|We are now in an election period.
p374_105|It's a very, very special day.
p313_229|It doesn't take much.
p313_263|It's up to Ann.
p313_088|This could be her way forward.
p364_073|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p313_318|That's the position that the MoD has adopted.
p313_192|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p313_065|The house was so well alight.
p313_374|I'm a little bit tired.
p313_331|Everyone's too upset to comment.
p313_356|You've obviously got an answer to it.
p313_312|I'm not a paedophile.
p313_163|It was a fiery game.
p313_305|SO now we know the secret.
p313_036|The waiting is over, well almost.
p313_289|I'm not a threat to coaches.
p313_389|That time is not far away.
p313_181|I hope we do.
p313_126|What's the point?
p376_346|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p313_347|This morning was very quiet.
p313_353|He was made redundant in February of last year.
p323_246|It appears to have been closed down.
p313_244|This was done by the council staff.
p295_322|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p313_373|Frank Warren is a great man.
p313_397|Instead, it's back to the drawing board.
p293_348|He quit in October.
p313_131|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p313_377|She's currently in foster care.
p313_145|However, it's not all bad news for women.
p313_082|This does not help.
p313_273|There is no more money.
p313_255|Our people are paying high prices.
p313_230|She asked us a lot of questions.
p313_174|Dewar is the medium.
p313_309|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p313_327|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p313_068|However, there is great potential in this right.
p341_406|They hold on for many years.
p313_190|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p313_278|Something was plainly wrong.
p313_097|But Allen is deadly serious.
p313_419|I didn't play all that well.
p313_216|We're still paying the price for that.
p313_070|I'm confident of the outcome this week.
p313_221|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p313_223|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p313_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
p313_134|At some point, the bill will be presented.
p313_111|It's just one of those things.
p333_313|I'm not blaming audiences.
p313_401|I found that much more challenging.
p313_366|The idea was presented to me.
p333_409|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p313_172|That is not a position they enjoy.
p313_279|Why should he go anywhere?
p313_294|That, though, is to miss the point.
p313_114|I was very fortunate.
p313_297|What's the point of staying sober?
p313_113|We played so well at times.
p313_242|I tried to push him away.
p313_239|I was an athlete.
p313_422|Now, that is a good deal.
p313_210|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p313_228|And then a funny thing happened.
p313_147|We haven't found out anything different.
p361_100|What has changed since then?
p313_304|I'm not a fan of books.
p313_115|Such a policy would be a disaster.
p313_276|There have been different reports from different people.
p313_219|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p313_208|It was good to score the goal today.
p313_414|We never agreed to it.
p313_050|My brother's buried under there.
p313_130|We need to make more inquiries about that.
p330_221|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p313_343|It's no less intriguing, however.
p313_100|They've just got to believe in themselves.
p293_102|This is not a European Army.
p313_333|But when we do it is great.
p374_352|As if they ever stopped.
p313_175|It was that kind of night.
p340_038|This is my personal assessment.
p313_039|It helped me to get noticed.
p313_214|We are a party for people, not against people.
p313_089|This gives us a lot of practice.
p313_199|So they will settle again.
p313_313|Some of their movement was excellent.
p313_227|That figure will always remain with me.
p313_073|It really has left the town in shock.
p313_132|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p313_293|This year, it was a little different.
p313_395|It's time to fight a decisive battle.
p313_084|That's why the ministers resigned.
p295_076|But then they scored their fourth.
p313_078|We are confident of taking that back.
p313_168|This one is a special case.
p313_059|It's back to how it used to be.
p313_291|It's never over until it's over.
p313_328|It went on to become an annual event.
p313_103|Although, you never know.
p313_150|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
p313_160|He'd never run the distance before.
p313_119|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p313_245|The truth is otherwise.
p313_277|It's an absolute disgrace.
p313_170|There is a simmering anger out there.
p313_052|What were they?
p313_137|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p313_146|But the championship is not over yet.
p313_161|I can make one further announcement.
p363_374|There is nothing to fear.
p313_218|It's not a wish list.
p293_183|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p313_152|I am ashamed of them.
p374_247|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p295_406|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p313_081|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p313_133|I'm sorry to hear this news.
p313_098|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p374_123|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p313_056|I've really noticed that this week.
p374_213|All these things have an impact.
p313_182|From now on there is no hiding place.
p313_067|Sandy was very active.
p313_166|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
p313_387|Sure, we have problems.
p313_299|The incident is being taken seriously.
p313_391|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p313_028|I intend to raise the matter there.
p341_098|It is a great honour and a privilege.
p341_193|It has to be a long-term commitment.
p341_046|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p341_195|Felt good about it.
p292_136|We cannot lose it.
p341_368|I don't have a new house.
p341_066|He is pretty upset.
p299_200|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p341_072|It is time to give her a rest.
p341_026|That's interesting to me.
p341_386|That gave us some confidence.
p341_373|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p341_055|I've just got to do this.
p341_095|It's a difficult one to play.
p299_096|We are trying to establish a date.
p341_393|Story time is over - it's a war.
p376_210|Today is not about contracts.
p299_235|I will not be pressured.
p341_383|Chris Paterson is a class act.
p314_099|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p341_182|Nobody ever knew it had happened.
p299_080|She added, It is a huge problem.
p341_325|That did not go down well.
p341_328|It is a question of balance.
p293_197|I'm a bit annoyed.
p341_334|For his opposite number, this was just triumph.
p341_249|It doesn't make sense.
p341_244|It was a big day.
p341_378|And it's not funny.
p376_258|He had other things on his mind.
p299_298|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
p341_267|She became very good at it.
p341_403|She will just have wanted her baby.
p341_229|I'm not saying he is finished.
p299_048|It's to do with play.
p376_211|We are going for it.
p341_381|They have learned from that.
p341_058|Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
p341_064|This is the crossroads.
p376_366|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p341_284|We've got a full house tonight.
p341_250|I'll go back home and see my family.
p341_199|What's the big idea?
p341_194|No such remedy has ever been pursued.
p341_097|We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
p238_447|I stayed away from the defence.
p341_350|He takes time out for everyone.
p299_399|Scotland is losing business.
p314_135|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p314_296|What are you going to do exactly?
p341_397|It was a sell-out.
p341_278|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p341_169|I am still very much a director.
p341_038|There is no escape.
p341_355|I have not been so angry for years.
p341_319|This is very bad news.
p299_348|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p299_394|If there is default.
p341_037|This has been blown out of all proportion.
p341_366|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
p341_160|You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
p341_068|Where is the human rights?
p341_158|But my heart is in athletics.
p341_339|They told us about it the next day.
p341_027|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p293_111|Look at his last couple of records.
p341_164|It was then into overtime.
p341_264|He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.
p292_132|What's happening to her?
p341_399|Things are going very well.
p341_147|There's a good chance of seeing something.
p341_256|Mind you, who wouldn't?
p299_102|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p299_099|It was a bit of a struggle today.
p341_283|Are you in this movie?
p341_285|If they don't, they won't get what they want.
p341_210|He explained to his audience.
p341_281|The manager knew me very well.
p341_238|We believe we have a strong case.
p333_370|Both managements are very supportive.
p341_289|We are aware of the two incidents.
p293_347|The feeling is awesome.
p299_123|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p341_110|It was love of Helen and the children.
p341_146|Their condition was described as stable.
p299_297|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p299_248|It was a tactical change.
p341_036|That was no surprise to me.
p299_215|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p299_376|We have been working together for some years.
p341_239|I lost it at the final whistle.
p293_358|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p299_067|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
p341_162|I'm working on that.
p341_375|Folk music is in her blood.
p341_041|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
p341_384|We only lost the third goal.
p341_287|Make sure you see it.
p301_134|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p299_302|They were the better side on the day.
p341_323|We do need to get the message across.
p341_029|The injuries are not too serious.
p293_025|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p301_037|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p341_344|We have to go for it.
p341_314|No-one thought about this.
p341_345|I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
p299_074|The settlement could run to millions.
p299_033|I am proud of moments like that.
p314_081|It had a gigantic effect.
p341_385|And that's the question for the Chamber.
p341_405|You have to have some hope and faith.
p364_047|We must not give in to bastards.
p299_262|Also, he was flawed.
p341_358|Nothing was going to go right.
p341_123|The lady is right.
p299_192|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
p341_389|Is this new report the answer?
p341_253|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p299_355|This is normal for him now.
p341_230|That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
p299_075|It does not stop at the border.
p341_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p307_220|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p376_383|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p341_157|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p341_349|I've already got them in.
p293_260|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p341_175|Of course he is.
p299_389|Maybe, who knows?
p341_409|He needs to be.
p299_056|I think it is a sensible change.
p341_213|He was a soldier.
p341_313|Calderwood would agree with that.
p341_216|It didn't get any better.
p299_316|Instead, she just went away.
p341_189|I've already done that.
p268_148|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p341_291|It was just one of those things.
p376_275|It was to no avail.
p307_081|He came in an army uniform.
p298_383|Mike Tyson went to prison.
p298_215|WHAT's in a name is this, the age of the Internet?
p298_405|He showed he has some things to learn.
p298_385|This is the first stage of catching up.
p298_401|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p298_045|Our dispute is with the company, not with the travelling public.
p298_395|I am just looking to God.
p298_382|We are being hijacked.
p330_168|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p298_377|I have learned a lot from him.
p298_173|We are all family men with children.
p298_393|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p298_273|It is now very clear that doesn't work.
p253_390|I've had my time.
p253_129|It's not a U-turn.
p251_339|He was not a big name.
p254_206|It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
p254_339|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p254_103|The group is due to report by the end of the year.
p237_301|That could change.
p256_242|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p254_372|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p254_381|Face to face
p254_392|I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
p254_391|Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
p254_169|We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
p254_289|The mood is good.
p254_396|We're looking for justice.
p254_384|The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
p251_041|They may be wrong.
p254_056|That time has passed.
p254_113|And I thought - we have to do something with this.
p254_235|He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
p238_195|This Patton will also return.
p333_219|If only we had known.
p333_191|When he took over it really took off.
p333_320|We will just get on with it.
p333_280|We know we can't rely on you.
p333_398|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p333_153|I will certainly be having words with him.
p293_252|That's why he plays for Scotland.
p374_088|Now it has been eclipsed.
p333_154|She is a valuable member of the Government.
p333_175|He just carried on filming.
p333_235|What's it all about?
p333_373|This is important for two reasons.
p292_080|That was him under pressure.
p333_407|However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.
p363_274|His funeral is not expected until next week.
p333_421|Three months or so later, they are returning.
p333_342|So, how will it be received in the US?
p333_419|They were in good humour, too.
p333_265|It has to be funded.
p293_287|They certainly do not socialise.
p333_321|We are worried about casualties.
p333_093|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p333_137|All the people thought that he would die.
p333_245|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p333_068|John was a very nice man.
p333_289|It's going to be quite a challenge.
p333_248|It is a weakness, and not the only one.
p292_378|That would have killed the match.
p292_408|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p333_295|We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
p333_141|The post will run for four years.
p333_343|He was different from the rest of us.
p333_246|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p333_099|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p333_192|I have been very nervous.
p333_080|But the tragedy did not stop there.
p333_085|It was different from our other work.
p292_027|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p333_283|It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
p333_205|It has come as a bombshell.
p333_126|This is our way to make our point.
p333_164|There are no charges.
p333_097|They didn't take you to mass graves.
p374_148|There is something in this.
p333_355|We have obviously got some work to do.
p333_186|No, they have not.
p333_212|We still don't know.
p333_367|There was a great support all round the route.
p230_401|You will not feel a thing.
p292_421|He was back to square one.
p259_094|Collaboration is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies.
p376_337|Some problems were too complex.
p236_287|Blair also had a penalty.
p259_385|I've always been a sensitive.
p259_457|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
p236_070|He was seen as the enemy.
p259_382|He is an excellent manager.
p273_106|New Year will be very busy.
p259_366|Industrial action has to hurt.
p259_206|In due course we will make an announcement.
p259_317|This would provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment.
p259_477|The price paid for it was not disclosed.
p259_130|It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult.
p268_279|Phase one was a shambles.
p259_388|It was a massive error of judgment.
p259_314|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
p259_455|Nobody has told the story.
p259_025|But it could prove disastrous.
p259_312|It seemed a logical expansion.
p259_037|Child benefit will not be affected.
p259_444|It means an enormous amount.
p259_353|We think the timing is good.
p259_414|It is the nature of his party.
p259_032|The function of the clerk is to provide advice.
p259_138|Scotland will finish the group in second place.
p259_056|They had been in Scotland on exercise.
p307_077|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p259_187|It is only the beginning.
p259_135|Reaction to the device was mixed.
p259_329|I was just so determined.
p238_317|Here the picture is broadly stable.
p259_169|He was right into football from an early age.
p259_286|You have got the evidence.
p273_381|The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.
p259_398|The principle is quite clear.
p259_271|He said the right things.
p340_048|None of the pieces was commissioned.
p259_071|Today it was really enjoyable.
p363_083|I have never seen anything like this.
p363_375|Just look at his record.
p363_040|I think we're a long way forward.
p238_452|We didn't want any trouble.
p363_086|That is my preference.
p363_280|The gap is closing.
p363_265|This is the root of their problems.
p363_036|It certainly is cause for concern.
p363_218|Where is the evidence?
p363_066|Lovely day isn't it?
p363_387|A decision is expected today.
p363_112|I sit at home a lot.
p363_359|They never seem to do anything about it.
p363_309|Norton was delighted with his successes.
p363_393|It is for the same reason.
p363_307|It's never happened before.
p363_043|His film is not.
p363_174|The only trouble is finding them.
p363_239|I'm so looking forward to it.
p363_041|The impact was immediate.
p363_269|She is under police escort.
p363_256|All winners should be tested.
p363_388|I am enjoying it.
p363_124|I welcome this Bill.
p363_229|Well, we know now.
p363_092|It was the turning point of the afternoon.
p363_037|It's on with a roller.
p363_259|It is not a soap opera.
p363_197|I wanted to get on with it.
p363_210|I wanted to have a go.
p267_327|You are looking at him.
p363_096|Where will the money come from?
p363_407|There's nothing she can't do.
p363_275|Now we have had enough.
p363_339|I am feeling on top of the world.
p363_045|In my experience, he does not do that.
p363_114|I hope the couples are still together.
p363_198|I don't think it's the area.
p273_272|It was a horrible moment.
p363_228|But we shall have to talk to him.
p363_419|This is actually true.
p363_355|One might think that it is a power.
p363_345|One was taken to hospital.
p267_210|The course has helped a lot.
p363_029|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p363_028|The proposals were not new.
p363_262|Where was the point in all this?
p363_389|It wasn't very pretty to watch.
p363_297|I want to make a difference.
p363_221|We don't want that at all.
p363_366|It is not needed, it should go.
p363_248|He is to be commended.
p363_052|But real life is not like that.
p363_091|We have not given up.
p363_380|We were very unhappy with the incident.
p363_406|I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
p363_025|It's never been to committee.
p363_326|This is an awful lot of money.
p363_227|They know nothing about the sport.
p295_224|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p363_058|We were upset about the referee.
p363_187|The prime minister will make the decision.
p363_270|However, that is not in itself enough.
p363_241|That ignorance is crucial.
p363_251|I don't feel like working.
p363_409|I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.
p363_095|If they are not, the commission will take action.
p363_337|I just had to go for it.
p363_062|He did that last Sunday.
p363_157|It appears to have been successful.
p363_304|Not all women are dismayed.
p363_065|Sentencing is also being considered in that review.
p363_142|I was deeply worried.
p363_163|I live for today.
p293_318|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
p363_341|I don't know, really.
p363_306|It is not just in Edinburgh.
p363_027|It was actually very, very difficult.
p363_290|The best team won.
p363_042|There is a new confidence about the club.
p363_110|It's harder, believe me.
p363_411|He died in September.
p287_228|We have learned a tremendous amount.
p293_319|Frankly, they have to crack down.
p363_356|This place is outstanding.
p363_152|The progress has been steady.
p363_186|He had an apartment ready.
p363_059|That is our objective.
p363_311|There is another side to it.
p363_225|We don't come here for our health.
p363_277|He is certainly not looking for another job.
p363_412|It was not even this century.
p363_164|I have been very stupid.
p363_382|It is something that we would support.
p363_212|We got on very well.
p363_113|That was certainly the case for the parties.
p376_115|We have still got the fight in us.
p363_117|These people are helpless.
p295_397|That is European law.
p363_351|Secondly, there is the question of money.
p363_245|I have not had much of him.
p363_272|We're going to fight it.
p363_232|The legal process could last weeks.
p363_046|That is good news.
p363_414|It's not going to last five minutes.
p363_106|He had never run the distance before.
p363_216|You are going to have to do it.
p363_085|It was that kind of war.
p363_315|The Old Firm are growing.
p363_107|I am the head.
p363_291|It being the weekend, there was no-one there.
p363_111|We are making no comment.
p363_076|Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
p363_352|He was later deported.
p363_171|He didn't know where to look.
p363_244|Clearly, there was a mix-up.
p363_420|Both were reduced to rubble.
p363_050|He was very grateful for his health.
p363_069|The show is not over.
p363_373|Only two things are certain.
p363_385|Does it really matter?
p363_193|Their appeal will be heard this week.
p363_392|It has been a massive success.
p363_089|It was decided he should be dismissed.
p363_078|We did not deserve to go through.
p363_190|It was far more important than that.
p363_132|There was something special about that.
p376_061|Maybe it will work there.
p363_358|But it is a fact.
p363_127|He is the man to beat.
p363_039|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p363_300|How do you feel?
p363_404|She doesn't know where to begin.
p363_391|Are these immoral?
p363_369|We have been overwhelmed by the response.
p363_284|It was quite a sight.
p363_090|But someone has got to do it.
p363_094|What has happened?
p363_125|This is not a problem.
p363_266|Two other men have recovered.
p363_343|Therefore there is a threat.
p363_206|The training will take place in Downing Street.
p363_129|Look at the turn-out.
p363_336|He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p363_364|Experience in this work is paramount.
p363_263|He was travelling to see his daughter.
p363_082|That can only be a good thing.
p363_372|I think we did well.
p363_421|It could have taken another two months.
p363_087|He later told The Herald, It is true.
p363_254|We stopped at half-time.
p363_170|So what's in store?
p363_161|I feel a little betrayed.
p363_109|It can be very worrying.
p363_033|He gave no other details.
p363_034|It's not an improvement for him.
p363_144|How does it all work?
p363_390|You have to go for it.
p295_308|This is your chance.
p363_128|We are getting not a penny.
p363_051|The nation has his music.
p363_064|The club is afflicted by injuries.
p363_061|He is not alone.
p363_180|Will he be here for the weekend?
p363_314|I'm a bit overwhelmed.
p363_363|It was great fun.
p295_379|Surely the answer is yes.
p363_073|It was just an accident.
p363_151|They will not be going back.
p363_167|But that was his nature.
p363_217|I was amazed at her knowledge.
p363_240|I think we can do well.
p363_252|Then one day it happened.
p363_131|It is very simple.
p363_330|He was a national treasure.
p363_347|Gritty he did not want.
p363_332|We need to regroup.
p363_158|This is a big game for them.
p363_182|Now is the time for action.
p363_278|I have a problem with these things.
p363_196|A decision is expected tomorrow.
p363_074|We are not commenting at the moment.
p293_343|It raises a serious question mark.
p363_080|All the time, that number was coming down and down.
p363_319|That would be the constructive way forward.
p363_057|There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
p363_316|They want to win the title.
p363_368|We have a business to run.
p363_384|We are in shock.
p363_285|But he was far from alone.
p363_188|THERE's only one word for it.
p363_317|Her concerns were not without foundation.
p363_397|You can't take a chance.
p363_168|We have been together for five years.
p363_053|So now we know.
p363_415|I am happy with my form.
p363_370|And there are others.
p363_313|It will be very damaging for research.
p363_299|He will have it within two weeks.
p363_148|It would be a masterclass.
p363_381|The challenge is to win a cup.
p363_386|I loved it - and so did my friend.
p363_101|I can't get it.
p363_226|That in itself is a joke.
p363_234|I can do this on my own.
p363_156|We have been extremely busy.
p363_247|We are taking no chances this time.
p363_253|I sit in the car.
p363_185|They were not consulted.
p363_323|That is taking place in Strathclyde.
p363_367|She had not suffered any physical injury.
p363_030|His party never arrived.
p363_048|He will never be forgotten.
p363_288|The Believer isn't just a movie.
p363_360|We're going to sleep.
p376_124|Ours is on for two days.
p363_283|And the other winners are.
p363_242|It was an excellent performance.
p363_126|he announced his plans.
p363_260|Whatever we do, we know we can do well.
p363_418|Overall, it has certainly worked out.
p363_140|Things are going well.
p363_271|That should not be their conclusion.
p363_257|We would like to see them in court.
p363_349|Nobody was able to escape.
p363_396|He will have something to say.
p363_378|I have no evidence.
p363_031|Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
p363_215|We can all understand that.
p363_153|It has no chance.
p363_122|Sadly, it is not to be.
p363_071|This is a judgment issue.
p363_353|I only found out about it this morning.
p363_219|It was important in training terms.
p363_150|I didn't really expect to be called up.
p363_308|It was a deeper deception.
p363_116|But that is not enough.
p363_324|He was in a mood.
p314_056|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
p363_173|There are two characters.
p363_146|There's a lot of it going on.
p239_137|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p363_088|It has come a long way since then.
p363_104|It's somewhere in between.
p363_302|It was not the right time for me.
p363_203|I really had to concentrate.
p295_240|I am very sorry to hear about this.
p363_230|He was only doing his job.
p363_338|It seems to go down well.
p376_195|You have no chance of planning permission.
p363_261|They may not always be so lucky.
p295_313|I think they are right to be impatient.
p363_344|She would love it.
p363_159|We still have to wait for that.
p295_264|What was the cause of all this outrage?
p363_413|That was really tough.
p363_178|That was a huge experience.
p363_237|By then it was too late.
p363_303|But they have the sound.
p237_243|It's a dead end.
p237_034|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p251_059|It's a real challenge.
p237_250|It's quite a line-up !
p237_338|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
p237_174|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
p237_258|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
p237_239|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p232_191|I wish I could say something.
p237_184|This is a sad day.
p237_206|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
p232_142|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
p255_133|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
p226_171|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p245_040|It's a great thing.
p230_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p251_220|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p245_087|The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p245_092|He's a star.
p288_312|He was solid.
p245_016|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p245_336|Action is needed now.
p245_062|He should have asked for a second opinion.
p245_185|He's not perfect.
p245_310|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
p232_299|He has retired.
p292_159|We don't even know his name.
p245_118|He has been under great pressure.
p241_342|I would miss him.
p255_352|He's very explosive.
p314_289|I'm not putting myself down.
p314_356|We don't want to push him.
p314_175|There is no substitute.
p314_312|That only came out during a radio interview.
p314_401|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p314_044|In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
p314_134|I'm not holding the club to ransom.
p314_252|A Scottish film studio is also being considered.
p301_208|We have no choice but to shut down.
p273_151|I'm not going to answer that right now.
p301_346|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p314_131|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
p314_170|They've got to get better.
p314_042|It is all about people being assaulted, abused.
p314_241|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p314_186|Clearly we were looking at this very carefully.
p314_392|We've been treated with complete contempt.
p314_127|I really hope he thinks that through.
p314_311|Clearly, she says, we would never resort to such devices.
p292_127|But the killer remains at large.
p314_025|The Scots are, however, in good company.
p314_047|I only half believe it.
p314_319|Lucky for us, he enjoyed the experience.
p314_396|We can make changes.
p314_373|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p314_059|The spirit in the squad is certainly good.
p314_051|I'm feeling pretty good.
p314_139|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p314_393|There must be boundaries.
p301_296|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p314_094|They are completely different from each other.
p314_209|You saw the football.
p314_076|I have got a knife.
p330_107|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p314_200|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p307_292|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p314_189|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p314_374|The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
p330_098|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p314_165|I should not be able to stand.
p314_167|Little Voice is on general release.
p314_215|We have an attorney on the ground.
p301_375|He has changed my life for ever.
p314_361|We are still going ahead with our plans.
p295_210|And what is she escaping from?
p307_336|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p314_410|He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.
p292_319|He had no answer.
p330_377|We are waiting for them to calm down.
p314_199|Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
p314_055|It was developed in the Gulf War.
p314_124|There are a lot of examples.
p301_270|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p314_340|However, we had no failures on our side.
p314_302|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p314_332|No, no, it's not what you think.
p314_219|That it is a brand name.
p314_264|He is young but not too young.
p314_414|I don't believe that money is the answer.
p301_396|It was early morning.
p314_288|The alliance said it may not wait.
p314_317|Neither was involved in violence.
p314_130|It's very tragic and traumatic.
p299_372|But then, that really is the point.
p299_295|I am not a free trader.
p299_160|Meanwhile, the problems of Ball continue to multiply.
p299_042|If you look at the beginning of Alien.
p299_393|We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.
p299_341|We just need the Government to act.
p330_344|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
p376_352|With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
p299_405|Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
p364_076|You see - this business is a good one.
p299_333|I have a bunch of veterans.
p299_106|That was the light relief.
p299_387|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
p299_034|This is a totally different order of agreement.
p299_174|He was as good as his word.
p293_157|Horses have some sense.
p299_354|Do you mean today?
p299_242|I was the only one arguing differently.
p299_400|We are working on the two things.
p299_252|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p364_259|That's the last thing he will do.
p299_183|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p299_230|I believe you may be that person.
p299_029|My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
p299_259|He is a right bastard.
p299_127|I've just got to build on this now.
p299_184|Our members are concerned about their futures.
p293_330|He's very young but he is growing up.
p376_245|There is a growing anger among the group.
p299_327|We could not have asked for any more.
p299_343|The criminal justice system does not do that.
p299_384|There is a lot of anger.
p299_025|I just went for it over the weekend.
p299_051|Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.
p299_062|It was created by genocide.
p299_052|That was the problem.
p299_391|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p299_301|Now there's an even bigger target.
p299_312|Why should we have been asked to share?
p299_224|But the row refused to go away.
p299_304|What went wrong?
p299_236|I had another good day.
p299_238|We should be trying to keep him in.
p376_162|One of these problems is the railways.
p299_280|We need to be looking to the future.
p364_075|It's not in my nature.
p293_357|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
p376_353|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p299_275|The things writers and directors say!
p307_115|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p307_182|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p323_181|This is a mental challenge.
p307_188|I hope you miss the cut.
p301_113|The conversion didn't go over either.
p301_030|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p301_051|It was, however, the wrong side.
p307_094|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p301_187|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p323_367|But we're not the same person.
p323_370|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p307_025|But it was a great decision he joked.
p301_092|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p301_132|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p307_142|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p307_341|I am not putting myself down.
p301_171|The problem arises because he does so much.
p301_135|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p323_364|However, who could have predicted this result?
p307_197|I want him to take on Gomez.
p323_235|I think my game is suited to grass.
p301_085|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p301_088|So other options had to be explored.
p301_074|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p301_146|You hope he prevails.
p301_064|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p301_026|They changed the world of music.
p323_105|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p301_065|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p307_046|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p323_244|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p301_148|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p301_150|But it looks good for next year.
p301_101|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p323_112|It doesn't make them evil.
p255_339|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p301_133|Both were later released after a check-up.
p323_291|He was just awesome.
p301_186|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p307_174|What, then, is the real thing?
p323_217|I have no plans to change the oath.
p301_059|It's the best of both worlds.
p301_072|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p323_079|The punishment was swift.
p323_173|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p301_143|All things are possible if you believe.

p301_052|She is now planning a visit.
p323_187|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p307_156|But you can't have it both ways.
p323_423|Harold is a rarity.
p307_232|That's the key issue isn't it?
p301_194|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p301_086|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p301_178|The big issue for us is the review.
p323_155|The encounter was to change his life.
p301_138|The son has autism and other problems.
p330_042|We did not even get a free kick.
p301_185|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p323_344|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p301_107|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p301_152|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p307_144|This was not just incongruous.
p307_035|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p301_163|This is a United Kingdom.
p323_365|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p301_097|He was married with a young child.
p301_196|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p307_078|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p323_413|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
p301_129|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p307_038|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p307_175|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p307_099|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p301_121|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p301_177|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p307_124|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p301_082|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p307_063|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p301_036|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p301_191|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p301_061|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p307_034|I kept my side of the bargain.
p301_330|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p323_230|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p323_150|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p307_141|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p307_130|We need to move forward together.
p323_392|This does not create any precedent.
p307_155|I was loving that little girl.
p307_184|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p301_043|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p301_139|I'm very puzzled by it.
p323_171|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p301_126|Tony Blair should get out more.
p307_042|I have played really well all year.
p323_323|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p307_105|Is your life a little too easy?
p323_145|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p307_122|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p323_198|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p307_028|The law has got to be upheld.
p307_031|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p307_112|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p301_269|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p301_391|I had no qualms about it.
p236_041|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p301_180|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p361_361|I am very sorry to be here.
p307_045|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p301_044|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p307_228|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p307_172|The answer is mayhem.
p307_149|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p295_025|It has never been worthwhile.
p246_111|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p288_238|He's got to go.
p288_363|So I left.
p288_407|The real enemy is in your own back yard.
p288_402|That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
p226_157|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
p288_026|It is a disaster area.
p251_264|We are ready.
p251_360|They got upset.
p251_279|Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
p241_061|It was all in a short period of time.
p292_354|The board of governors must act.
p292_026|O, Is he conscious?
p292_374|As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.
p292_165|Are you all right at the front?
p292_034|It was a deceit.
p340_415|There are two interests in this woodland.
p292_357|Now they have decided to have a rethink.
p292_211|People have no chance of getting out.
p293_066|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
p295_172|You're not going to forget something like that.
p292_038|It is just like the stock market.
p292_387|Billy knew he was attracted to women.
p292_254|His game was complete.
p292_241|It is up to us to approve it.
p292_422|We didn't get any from his face.
p292_390|This was not helpful.
p292_224|No means testing will be required.
p292_046|That was not due to me.
p292_082|I was in prison for a year.
p292_057|One woman refused to sit down.
p292_298|I wonder if Rangers do that?
p292_193|How can they get one?
p292_230|If only he knew himself.
p292_306|His descent was pathetic.
p292_155|That takes time and games and practice.
p292_268|Inquiries are still in an early stage.
p295_279|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p292_388|The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.
p292_164|These are serious matters.
p292_406|A suspicion was not enough.
p292_030|I thought the game was very poor.
p323_401|Five officers were injured.
p361_243|It's a technical demand.
p292_389|Such cases are on the increase.
p292_249|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p292_040|I wish the solutions were as easy.
p323_373|PR will be just one of them.
p292_044|The idea has potential for the future.
p292_055|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
p292_029|IT IS the last week of rehearsals.
p292_032|I don't expect to be here tomorrow.
p292_140|I've got to get on with my career.
p292_107|That, however, is the end of the good news.
p292_086|I am constantly changing my mind.
p292_226|I don't think that's very fair.
p292_327|They always seem to produce.
p292_033|Or it's not really for us, if you like.
p292_189|It is a very sad day.
p292_291|For that much we must be grateful.
p292_035|You are in power.
p292_403|I knew she was going to win.
p292_054|I'm trying not to think about that.
p293_259|I find the whole affair disturbing.
p292_271|The company reacted very, very well.
p292_163|The president will not be removed from office.
p292_115|I'm just going to do my best.
p292_071|I didn't think they would be that stupid.
p292_118|We have no knowledge of this.
p292_039|And the newspapers were full of it.
p292_167|It was the first time they met.
p292_203|It has affected me.
p292_294|That will be the key to success.
p292_359|There's no choice is there?
p292_088|Ending a tenancy is a last resort.
p292_263|They loved it and it showed.
p292_417|I will always remember the horrible images.
p364_131|That's why he is a national treasure.
p292_295|They are in good spirits.
p292_191|I have nothing to hide.
p292_110|There could still be some to come forward.
p292_375|That's an equally important factor.
p292_413|The balance is all wrong in this country.
p292_041|She does not see anything ever changing.
p292_386|He is just a wonderful actor.
p292_423|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p292_042|It doesn't come any better than this.
p292_052|It was all for good reason as well.
p292_424|It's time for a change.
p292_371|It's their duty to protect them.
p292_267|Just what we didn't need.
p292_264|However, by then the damage had been done.
p292_396|I'd rather have been playing.
p292_028|They are being deported from their homes.
p292_205|I have no conflict with them.
p292_412|They would not tell us.
p292_343|And right now, it isn't there.
p292_025|I was not involved in these discussions.
p292_372|The Cup has come home.
p292_280|That never happens in real life.
p238_313|Movie stars are public property.
p238_044|It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
p238_084|He's very young and very keen to do well.
p268_229|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p239_027|And so was a photograph.
p238_298|They will probably come back.
p239_451|Either way, it's very funny.
p238_390|It's difficult to put a date on.
p238_144|All the employees are redundant.
p238_379|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
p238_174|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
p238_188|He is survived by his wife and two sons.
p239_152|Since then, things have improved.
p238_101|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
p238_342|He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
p238_259|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p238_338|We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
p238_042|We want to get back into the Champions League.
p238_373|But you never won any games.
p238_398|Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
p238_306|No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
p238_370|Not that Barber has been unhappy.
p238_397|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
p238_448|Our performance continues to be outstanding.
p268_241|It would seem a natural progression.
p238_104|That would be the case with Dundee.
p239_048|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
p268_167|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
p238_073|And then there's the racial hassle.
p238_458|I have worked as a stand-up there often.
p238_133|We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
p238_318|Sadly, it does not end there.
p238_230|Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
p238_343|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
p238_389|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
p238_221|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
p238_456|Now it has doubled in size.
p238_245|I was a lucky man tonight.
p238_334|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
p238_362|It was a good workout.
p238_371|We will likely look for new investors.
p239_311|Celtic were the losers then.
p268_230|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
p238_444|I believe we can handle this okay.
p238_347|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
p238_325|Their conclusions were never published.
p268_222|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
p238_181|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
p238_145|His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
p238_378|It was really quite amazing.
p239_329|He was admitted to hospital.
p238_162|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p268_057|But it couldn't happen overnight.
p268_112|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p238_423|It also makes a habit of collecting people.
p238_212|It is time for confession.
p238_131|This is a sizeable part of our business.
p238_138|Monty is great in his own backyard.
p238_368|We can have no complaints.
p238_282|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
p239_072|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
p238_093|He seems to have everything.
p238_032|The staff are very good.
p238_445|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
p238_237|Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
p267_214|They're going to open in early summer.
p238_376|I have little time for analysts.
p238_285|But I was glad to see these interviews.
p238_085|It is somewhere to be.
p238_319|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
p268_085|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
p238_172|We continue to hold the shares.
p295_212|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p238_455|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
p268_134|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
p238_289|He is a serial Conservative assassin.
p238_194|He has had success at every level.
p238_449|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
p238_353|This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
p238_424|Got to get my sunglasses.
p238_094|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p238_066|It's the performance we want.
p239_256|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p238_046|Separate approvals would be needed for these.
p238_388|His successor was only appointed last month.
p239_447|Hard cash is needed now.
p238_401|He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
p238_271|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
p238_167|We can't get over it.
p268_123|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
p238_399|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
p238_141|Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
p323_228|She became a heroine of my childhood.
p361_401|It was cynical and callous.
p238_214|Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
p238_065|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
p238_036|Let there be no doubt about that.
p238_217|I will not take part in Edmonton.
p238_460|It is business as usual.
p340_298|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p293_115|The door is open.
p330_343|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p293_094|We've been overwhelmed by the response.
p293_037|I have got to adopt the same approach.
p293_203|Nothing is ruled out.
p293_043|We can be proud of our achievements.
p293_076|More than half of the school collapsed.
p323_109|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
p293_383|The penalty was the turning point.
p293_274|There are two offerings from Scotland.
p293_108|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
p293_071|So the challenge is against ourselves.
p293_041|I would just like someone to confess.
p293_392|The aircraft was totally destroyed.
p293_212|I'm just gonna hit the shot.
p293_216|A web site's planned for November.
p293_154|It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p340_345|When will this change?
p293_228|These will be finally corrected by next week.
p293_232|Three others were wounded.
p293_173|I am very shocked.
p293_349|The family also declined to discuss the case.
p293_169|I just want to enjoy myself.
p330_336|Will he be given time?
p293_340|I have great sympathy with these people.
p293_146|Perhaps it should stay there.
p293_335|They had asked not to be named.
p293_388|I am sure that this will happen again.
p293_337|A whole range of factors are involved.
p293_327|Life is too short.
p293_192|But he is something special, is he not?
p293_222|Sadly the jury were not convinced.
p293_303|There will be no disruption to teaching.
p293_230|We had no idea that this letter existed.
p273_123|It feels like a privilege.
p293_177|It's been such a long haul.
p293_127|The Taliban response was swift.
p293_306|Again the verdict was not proven.
p376_390|It will vote with the US.
p293_138|Somehow they got out.
p293_396|I should never have come over to Fife.
p293_307|We've just got to work a bit better.
p293_194|A final decision is expected by Friday.
p323_233|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p293_384|I have chosen to do this research.
p293_359|The initial reaction was disbelief.
p293_125|Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.
p293_279|That, however, is only part of their story.
p293_196|We will only move forward.
p293_354|Failure is a curious concept.
p293_209|Clearly, we could go on like this all day.
p293_339|They would love to do more films.
p364_220|That suggests that out fitness is good.
p293_208|His conclusion is upbeat.
p293_067|A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.
p330_421|We will do so again.
p293_140|I've been very nervous.
p293_386|Michael's putting on a brave face.
p293_241|So what's wrong with Scotland?
p361_273|My husband was fighting for his life.
p293_237|That was my own personal decision.
p293_046|Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.
p293_117|She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
p293_170|We are concerned that things should be safe.
p293_168|So, easy does it.
p293_336|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p323_123|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p330_324|We've had our problems at the club.
p293_089|A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.
p293_213|He will not be carrying out any surgery.
p293_130|They have their own interests and techniques.
p293_131|Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.
p293_367|Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.
p293_118|These are long-term investments.
p293_355|But it can happen for Tiger.
p293_186|Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.
p293_346|The attitude and commitment was decent.
p293_107|They will now have to justify their position.
p293_143|The proposals were never taken seriously.
p293_205|He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.
p293_051|Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
p293_039|It's a sensible management decision.
p293_282|We very much regret that it has occurred.
p293_078|I can live with just the one.
p293_267|It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.
p293_312|The British public is nothing if not fickle.
p293_141|Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
p364_200|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p293_099|They must put them back.
p273_318|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
p287_033|I thought it was an accident.
p287_306|Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
p287_089|We intend to change the model.
p287_246|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
p287_049|It is quite a figure.
p287_177|People like to talk about these things.
p287_158|This much I can tell you.
p340_276|They might be surprised by the response.
p267_366|It's only a matter of scale.
p287_305|The answer is with ourselves.
p268_219|We had to add value.
p287_051|It depends on the couple.
p287_388|My dad is all right.
p287_376|The hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.
p287_125|The money needs to go to the front line.
p287_136|It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
p236_074|We did it for the jersey.
p225_221|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p287_371|We knew he was very creative.
p287_328|It wasn't a good day for us.
p287_032|But a solution has been found.
p230_240|They need to win a trophy.
p287_412|They are looking for profit.
p287_087|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
p287_201|Getting this right is essential.
p287_095|It would be the end of farming.
p287_149|That shows the strength of the US Tour.
p361_066|But we are very near.
p287_375|SE is well down that road.
p287_127|I miss the freedom that I had.
p362_029|It was a fairy tale.
p287_104|I was impressed with them.
p236_189|Tomorrow is a new day.
p287_232|The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
p364_260|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
p287_321|I have signed a contract.
p287_083|It was not an insult.
p287_307|There is no evidence for that.
p287_304|We can work all night.
p287_068|Now the plot is perfect.
p239_267|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p287_348|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
p287_062|It has been an amazing day.
p287_344|I think it's about time.
p340_051|This has been a difficult time for me.
p340_279|They've had a good start as well.
p340_249|We've got to get this right.
p340_383|I hadn't had that before.
p340_042|This is great news.
p340_411|And it will be a challenge.
p340_233|So it should be.
p340_325|There was nothing sinister in that.
p340_395|It wasn't the second one.
p340_154|I've never regretted my decision.
p340_256|It was quite simply, delicious.
p340_044|That was a month ago.
p340_133|I certainly would not accept this decision.
p340_370|It is a tragedy for the area.
p340_348|I am an innocent man.
p340_382|We were all afraid.
p340_409|It will not be easy.
p340_172|It is no more than a shell.
p340_385|That is to miss the point.
p340_057|It needs a rethink.
p340_170|As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.
p340_310|The difference was amazing.
p340_198|This is a disaster for us.
p340_290|It wasn't really like that at all.
p340_219|Everyone here is heartbroken.
p340_175|It was very close.
p340_268|Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
p340_321|Structural changes will never be enough.
p340_297|I think they have got it completely right.
p340_272|That was our mission.
p340_144|How did he know?
p340_130|You need that freedom in society.
p340_173|And did they have sex?
p340_197|This was all well and good.
p340_369|Frankly it was disgusting.
p340_181|And that's it?
p340_257|I can't believe it happened.
p340_327|Is that what it's about?
p340_191|We haven't been able to go and see.
p340_247|They deserved to beat us in the replay.
p236_379|The seller was not revealed.
p340_328|And the audience is a surprise.
p340_330|Let's make him a show.
p340_260|They were his words.
p340_061|He was right of course.
p340_264|We've had a lot of adjusting to do.
p340_228|I don't like to fail.
p340_277|I've done it all.
p340_041|We didn't deserve to win.
p340_306|Sub Not Used, McCall.
p340_244|The medal itself is not that important.
p340_398|Detectives are still working on the case.
p340_157|So we started building a home.
p340_153|It really is tremendous.
p340_417|It is a good result.
p340_056|Where is the money coming from?
p340_075|Would she remember the music?
p340_386|It will be a new experience.
p340_213|It was properly reported to us.
p340_164|My brother is not like that.
p340_046|It would be another reason to live.
p340_303|I've heard it all before.
p295_358|He was elected as a councillor last year.
p340_087|But we never wanted to do that here.
p340_100|Or did it?
p340_315|I'm going to win the next two.
p340_216|Everything happened so quickly.
p340_141|He was shaking like a leaf.
p340_287|And that is very good indeed.
p340_235|It's hard to say.
p340_230|He may have a long wait.
p340_132|Who do you think will win?
p340_243|We just did not want to believe it.
p340_148|They are working very well.
p340_308|She died a few days later.
p340_390|It is a challenge for all of us.
p340_200|This is your life.
p340_407|We shall not do that.
p340_263|People were very confused.
p340_159|It will not happen overnight.
p241_310|It was a question of patience.
p340_145|He will have to live with his words.
p340_177|It gives us hope.
p340_199|What does that mean?
p340_163|What then is wrong?
p340_359|It all happened so quickly.
p340_291|What will happen to them now?
p340_098|He did not have to stop and think.
p340_401|There was much to be positive about.
p340_033|We don't find any danger from them.
p340_102|His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
p340_271|They made up for it on Saturday.
p295_372|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p340_266|The people have been really friendly.
p340_389|IT had to happen.
p340_106|He didn't bother a soul.
p340_246|The time for change is now.
p340_374|There are not enough of them.
p340_364|It simply doesn't happen.
p340_090|He said, we're delighted by the vote.
p340_194|I would be interested in another attempt.
p230_292|It is a recipe for success.
p340_068|It is time for the talking to stop.
p340_193|I can't say anything.
p340_178|We can't determine that clearly.
p340_079|He is now back in Britain.
p340_069|We were very close.
p340_113|The film is on a tightrope.
p340_402|It wants them to go home.
p340_006|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p340_399|I reported it but nothing was done.
p340_017|Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
p340_400|They were not defeated.
p340_318|They have not changed at all.
p340_367|I love it here.
p340_202|He can be beaten.
p340_174|But he was a really nice man.
p340_420|It was one New Year.
p340_203|He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
p340_047|I felt under a lot of pressure.
p340_180|Are you the man from The Herald?
p340_223|This produces exactly the opposite effect.
p340_368|Things are on track.
p340_414|It means a huge amount.
p340_032|But someone has to take them.
p340_080|There was no commission.
p340_343|Well, there can be no complaints about this one.
p340_422|Our policy is already working well.
p340_229|I really didn't think he would.
p340_270|I hope he comes back.
p340_027|We've just decided to do something about it.
p340_267|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
p340_380|They are expected to be released today.
p340_156|The wind was coming from all directions.
p340_341|She is deeply distressed.
p340_335|The government agreed to pay.
p340_074|I'm sure that they will learn.
p295_341|The last few weeks have been really bad.
p340_323|That was always the danger.
p340_351|I'm looking forward to coming home.
p340_384|We have a plan in place.
p340_332|People are using it in their daily lives.
p340_059|He would have been wrong.
p340_375|It has been a frustrating one.
p340_206|They are very clever and very dangerous.
p340_166|It was very exciting.
p340_314|I have still to hear about that.
p340_326|But don't just take my word for it.
p340_218|I am feeling a bit better.
p340_331|I'd never heard anything like it before.
p340_288|We could have had no new money.
p340_231|They have already done that.
p340_337|It was a very terrible thing.
p340_413|The power of religion is so strong.
p340_269|That, though, is not true.
p340_137|This research is extremely promising.
p340_117|We have got to the top.
p340_317|They want that school.
p340_026|We are not prepared to do that.
p340_060|He played really, really well.
p340_349|The improvement today was fantastic.
p340_307|Now they had it.
p340_360|It is working well.
p340_119|And it worked, so we kept it.
p340_339|It has been an extremely long haul.
p340_346|You know the score.
p340_254|Let's make this clear.
p340_082|It is time to be realistic.
p340_092|This is a terrible tragedy.
p340_378|What's in a name?
p340_099|We deserved to win it.
p340_371|He was not entirely correct.
p340_286|I have spoken to my brother.
p340_189|Yet it seemed to work.
p340_192|It works, as well.
p340_344|They said they would.
p340_025|It would be nice.
p340_281|One thing is clear.
p340_185|Of course the ending was fantastic.
p340_324|Will they fall in love?
p340_285|They were very unfair to him.
p340_078|Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.
p340_149|And he listens to his artists as well.
p340_031|He was very close.
p340_329|They worked on it for three hours.
p340_152|This is not quite right.
p340_184|But that is not an issue for now.
p340_105|We believe it to be completely without merit.
p340_155|This is a recipe for disaster.
p340_294|We are not collecting.
p340_103|He almost admitted as much.
p340_296|I thought the dancing was over.
p340_139|Weather conditions were good, he added.
p340_372|I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
p340_073|This can be extreme.
p340_305|We will not give up on the truth.
p340_029|But it's not just about that.
p340_250|The film was great.
p340_265|I am very relieved.
p340_070|If only it were so.
p340_071|They do not deliver.
p340_392|I don't believe in God.
p340_356|But he did not appear.
p295_281|Surely it can't get any worse.
p340_186|I want to be frank.
p340_258|Thankfully it was cleared up.
p340_112|Are there any he wants to play?
p340_338|Let's not take too much for granted.
p340_065|This has been a long process.
p340_282|We might never see him again.
p340_362|He said nothing of the sort.
p340_259|The game will be at a football stadium.
p340_319|One is investment, one is reform.
p340_358|The time was right.
p340_239|They are now collapsing.
p340_035|They were appalling, disgraceful.
p340_050|But it was no problem.
p340_365|We wanted to do something different.
p340_377|But we wouldn't want them any other way.
p340_352|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p340_036|Who was that?
p340_394|It's good to be back.
p340_404|Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
p340_067|It's probably just as well.
p340_304|We are not there yet.
p340_089|The money will go straight to the headteacher.
p340_165|He was very fit.
p340_225|You have to keep it on the fairways.
p340_289|It wasn't an easy decision.
p340_095|He said he never saw it.
p340_210|I had just taken it off.
p340_123|Yes, we can beat them.
p340_222|We have no further comment to make.
p340_241|Government funding is not a problem.
p340_252|They set up to win the hole.
p340_293|The Dream is as hard as they come.
p340_094|I'm delighted to be coming back home.
p340_309|What is their concern?
p340_204|Why does he do it?
p340_064|That, however, was the exception.
p340_334|Would that be for men and women?
p340_214|He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.
p340_108|Fishing is a declining industry.
p340_387|I didn't see it.
p340_151|Annika is very, very fit.
p340_312|But it is historic.
p340_232|Later, a very different story emerged.
p340_167|It is clear that change is required.
p340_316|You know it was good fun.
p340_115|I have never been in anything like that.
p340_208|We lost out a little bit.
p340_150|He is advised that he has done so.
p340_340|I'll need to discuss it with my family.
p340_072|However, that is just for starters.
p340_236|Her heart was not in it.
p340_301|There is a lot of fear.
p340_107|That was my first reaction.
p340_104|So what is the problem?
p340_408|My daughter was really, really innocent.
p340_190|I think it was just a tragic accident.
p340_274|The second half was a different affair.
p340_058|Why does it work?
p267_057|That way I won't have to do anything.
p267_321|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
p236_107|They will notice a difference.
p267_311|We will make a statement tomorrow.
p267_169|It is premature to speculate on the impact.
p267_128|They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
p267_317|I am not concerned with protection of the public.
p267_296|He wants to talk a lot.
p230_122|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p267_175|I would not count on it.
p267_026|He may not need to force that message.
p267_258|They were back in full training yesterday.
p267_092|They were a lovely couple.
p236_049|This is the interesting part.
p267_276|A lot of their players have developed in the English league.
p267_361|They have created a business.
p267_359|We live on an island.
p267_078|He can win every week.
p226_212|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p330_355|I've got my own ideas.
p267_174|It is not a threat.
p267_179|The European Union is a case in point.
p267_406|I thought he was an animal.
p267_058|It's just the timing of the game.
p267_055|So I liked the challenge.
p267_103|He has done that with a great deal to spare.
p267_314|I will not be afraid.
p267_050|It is a different animal.
p236_103|It's not a lack of effort.
p267_182|A team is a team.
p267_086|They need to find a form of words.
p267_181|It is a common problem.
p267_328|This is a source of real concern for the area.
p267_398|There were no plans for a rights issue.
p236_380|People are on the alert.
p273_400|The results will take second place.
p267_249|He declined to give any details.
p267_373|They are used to the big stage.
p232_391|You thought it was a headache.
p267_418|Further new equity was raised in a placing in January.
p267_152|That is not too bad.
p267_329|It's not an easy life.
p267_106|I was always a little behind.
p267_333|It makes a compelling display.
p268_194|Lee Westwood has other ideas.
p268_198|They have inherited the human rights abusers.
p268_125|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
p268_104|He will be kept informed.
p268_092|In fact, I have even had a bet on them.
p268_088|It is time for new ways for the church.
p268_026|He got very close tonight.
p361_081|Kenny Miller might come through.
p268_070|The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
p268_121|Or so the story goes.
p268_072|We deserved the three points.
s5_335|Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
p268_232|Years ago it was really quite simple.
p239_193|In addition, margins have been maintained.
p239_398|We were beaten by the better team.
p268_205|McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse.
p268_263|The shoppers knew it before City investors did.
p268_283|But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
p239_149|I was given no instructions by no-one.
p239_255|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
p268_266|We believe in the medium term.
p268_273|A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
p268_127|The Breadwinner came home from Africa.
s5_263|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
p239_341|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
p268_164|And so the cycle continues.
p268_342|Plans were made to expand.
p268_058|It was just too much for us.
p268_049|The latter option was chosen.
p239_111|Instead, another depression came in.
p268_202|It is all to do with the coaching.
p268_090|I am glad I wasn't in it.
p268_314|It was a lovely sunset.
p268_108|Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
p268_264|The planning appears to have paid off.
p268_261|The Dutchman was pleased with the result.
p268_128|Their season has been consigned to history.
p268_028|Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
p268_373|I have huge respect for him as a journalist.
p268_079|He also had a Scottish grandfather.
p268_044|However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
p268_046|Something has to give sometime.
p268_268|They were never seen again by friends or relatives.
p268_227|He wants to be competing for titles and medals.
p268_356|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
p268_035|It's as we were yesterday.
p268_068|This was a far cry from his election pledges.
p268_284|Injuries have taken their toll.
p239_352|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
p268_217|However, this concern appears to be misguided.
p268_053|The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.
p268_368|Weather should not be a factor.
p268_178|We are happy with the referee.
p268_391|This is a load of nonsense.
p255_151|He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
p255_025|He has not been named.
p255_298|I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
p256_106|Get to know him.
p255_241|It is mainstream.
p255_281|He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
p255_338|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
p255_158|The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p307_382|Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
p307_414|Now you see him, now you don't.
p307_192|That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.
p307_165|I'm aware that somebody made a threat.
p307_256|Wanger was never like this.
p239_476|Banking stocks were hit hard.
p239_262|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
p239_259|We have expanded too quickly.
p239_211|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
p239_429|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
p239_237|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
p239_490|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
p239_086|Or so the theory goes.
p239_207|We are now working with full-time on future product.
p239_443|They should not feel under threat.
p239_377|Commitment is released on Liberty.
p239_260|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
p239_162|I think the referee was good.
p239_334|Royal Bank declined to comment.
p239_302|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
p239_198|He said the director had been completely friendly.
p239_448|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
p239_254|She replied, It could be.
p239_276|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
p239_489|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
p239_461|Inventories are coming under control.
p239_070|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
p239_194|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
p239_220|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p239_209|He is a very talented player.
p239_376|It was launched in February last year.
p239_381|We have not been approached.
p239_350|Translation - we got it wrong.
p239_434|All the pieces fit together perfectly.
p239_095|It was fun, but not a living.
p239_273|I thought we were fantastic.
p239_406|This game is very evenly balanced.
p239_171|Those three weeks are totally lost.
p239_104|I am so proud of him.
p239_467|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
p239_032|That's all I was trying to do today.
p239_301|Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
p239_403|Turnover was highest in telecoms.
p239_375|This should come as no surprise.
p239_437|Things are going to change over the next six months.
p239_464|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
p239_397|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
p239_322|There were also some interesting questions and answers.
p239_115|The partners are looking for answers.
p239_400|Analysts were impressed with progress made.
p239_134|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
p239_100|Sales are falling after years of growth.
p239_043|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
p239_261|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
p239_345|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p239_499|I am not unduly surprised.
p239_109|People will have to be patient.
p239_484|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
p239_426|It certainly feels that way.
p239_468|The money is within the total allocation.
p239_238|Further details are expected later.
p239_298|We may need to take some very radical measures.
p239_103|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
p239_196|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
p239_036|That can cost him a fortune.
p239_293|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
p239_141|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
p239_428|Or maybe it's the other way around.
p239_475|I am sorry, but I forgot.
p239_439|The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
p239_110|I can't remember a lot of it.
p239_363|The actual increases will be announced next month.
p239_028|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
p239_460|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
p239_249|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
p239_078|I haven't got there yet.
p239_139|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
p239_082|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
p239_253|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
p239_102|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
p239_382|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
p239_057|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
p239_224|But it's an enjoyable job.
p239_372|That took about two years.
p239_275|It's going to be very closely watched.
p256_090|It was nice.
p256_094|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p256_152|We should be clear about the role of government.
p256_295|They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
p364_068|I see no need to change.
p376_087|The best defence is a good offence.
p376_261|But it's there to be won.
p376_323|It was just great.
p376_237|Here we go again.
p376_096|Audiences there were shocked.
p376_107|After that, it's never the same again.
p376_130|It's the start of something new.
p376_033|We are doing well.
p376_393|We are not interested in selling him.
p376_085|It will not work a second time.
p376_287|This is a major step forward for the carers.
p376_274|We will not get rid of them.
p376_209|It was a bonus for me really.
p376_153|The car was perfect.
p364_202|The attitude was good today.
p376_363|I'm delighted for the lads.
p376_357|It could really have been a disaster.
p376_113|Now is not the moment to leave.
p376_174|As well it might be.
p376_400|I was never invited.
p376_066|It was a good win for us.
p376_257|I really wanted the part.
p376_070|It has not come.
p376_159|It was good to work with them.
p376_316|What are the likely solutions?
p376_272|I don't suppose it matters that much.
p376_042|I was all alone.
p376_218|I am still waiting for her.
p376_099|We're still in the process of making changes.
p376_325|But they will be less attractive than that.
p376_188|This is still not good enough.
p376_290|They are still in shock.
p376_260|It was just a matter of time.
p376_413|That will be the office.
p364_207|In many ways it was disastrous.
p295_352|Worse still, it can be infectious.
p376_251|Nothing has been decided yet.
p376_233|I am just in a state of shock.
p364_044|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
p376_040|However, you never know.
p376_418|Indeed, it has already.
p376_404|We were fortunate to get an own goal.
p376_090|It was nice to come back.
p376_345|I did not feel the pressure.
p376_285|We are playing good football.
p364_163|There was nothing anyone could do.
p376_055|I'm looking forward to the next two weeks.
p376_264|Nothing else will do.
p376_359|I told him to stop.
p295_412|That can happen so easily.
p376_234|I really hope he comes back.
p376_184|That would be a miracle.
p376_232|I have never done that.
p376_098|It's just not very nice.
p376_360|Now they have to do something about it.
p376_373|In the event, it was to be the latter.
p376_131|It doesn't mean that much.
p376_378|They took that away.
p364_190|The state is controlled by the left.
p376_243|But he will do anything.
p376_342|There was no evidence against him.
p376_029|I am not interested in the past.
p376_303|I was close enough.
p376_030|I've got to be pleased with that.
p376_330|It seems to be politics at work again.
p376_031|They have done nothing of the sort.
p376_071|It has really been quite appalling.
p376_217|He didn't win the title.
p376_198|There is a pause.
p376_282|It is no surprise at all.
p376_411|It was a surprising decision.
p376_334|There would be famine.
p376_369|We are looking forward to next season.
p376_109|It is not just about the money.
p376_416|They were good neighbours.
p376_396|The firm was working.
p376_089|That is the case and remains the case.
p376_306|I have been doing it for years.
p376_065|It will be great.
p376_339|It was all image and no substance.
p236_359|Scotland is the home of golf.
p376_293|I can't believe that is the way forward.
p364_042|Since then it has become a tradition.
p364_138|It's not their fault.
p376_419|I've never done that before in my life.
p376_361|His strike was superb.
p364_117|It was an important part of the course.
p376_241|However, the story may have an happy ending.
p376_265|There is a precedent for the theory.
p376_091|It's a step forward.
p376_302|It's going to be massive.
p376_213|But he will be extremely active.
p376_412|He's a very promising player, indeed.
p295_100|You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
p376_168|She failed to win another game.
p376_398|This one would have been.
p376_212|Neither has gone to war.
p376_197|I am the leader.
p376_385|There's not going to be a formula.
p376_214|There was a bit of pressure.
p376_386|They have given up.
p376_263|I hope we can still find a solution.
p376_196|This is very disturbing news.
p376_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their homes in the sky.
p376_111|But the casting is also bizarre.
p376_041|Who did it doesn't really matter.
p252_381|An appeal was unlikely.
p376_144|We had never seen him before.
p376_190|I'm really proud of him.
p376_374|We are just waiting for news.
p376_348|This is the direction we need to go.
p376_038|Fuller was the difference.
p376_370|It cannot go on for ever like this.
p376_175|That is no bad thing.
p376_344|Anything would be better than this retirement.
p376_060|And that is about it.
p376_252|Almost everyone had some input.
p376_333|They are unable to say anything.
p376_093|That is the worry.
p376_321|It is just not working.
p376_047|A major is a major.
p376_403|I am glad that he is angry.
p376_239|Their attitude was great.
p376_104|I probably was wrong.
p376_414|I was not about to hit him.
p376_270|I should be doing that for her.
p376_138|We are not giving up.
p376_340|I know it is going to be difficult.
p376_181|It is a lot of fun.
p376_227|There is no need for that call.
p376_199|I'd already had them all.
p246_231|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
p246_206|I have decided to quit the show.
p246_049|The State would provide.
p246_123|I just wanted a break.
p246_257|I could have got out a long time ago.
p246_335|He loved the moment.
p246_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p246_279|It is so very obvious.
p273_167|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p232_087|No progress has been made.
p273_221|That was a problem for me.
p273_423|That means that nobody can do it.
p273_294|was everything done to save the people?
p273_227|It had so much to do with the output.
p273_104|Got to win today, though.
p273_032|It carries a double message.
p273_369|The statement finally came on Wednesday night after the market had closed.
p273_107|There's still plenty of time left.
p273_414|I would like to continue to develop.
p273_074|This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
p273_068|The creditors have lost a lot.
p273_235|He said the move followed a downturn in business travel.
p273_140|Today is not a victory.
p273_105|The pressure is on them.
p273_322|But it is a slow process.
p273_420|She's had to suffer for the last six years.
p273_128|The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
p273_153|The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
p273_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p273_214|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
p273_317|You are talking about a matter of life and death.
p236_402|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
p273_126|We'll have to think about it.
p295_386|That, however, is only part of the story.
p295_364|But no decision has been made.
p295_403|We wanted to run away with her.
p295_326|It was hugely popular decision.
p330_186|I think it'll be a great occasion.
p295_034|We thought we would never see them again.
p361_389|I think it was entirely the right decision.
p295_325|We're very close to making it in Europe.
p295_183|The deadline is real and absolute.
p295_160|We're in England for the time being.
p295_254|We're all involved in creating the work.
p295_093|Nothing has changed from the season before.
p295_119|There were far more pressing matters to consider.
p295_189|That's how he did the damage.
p295_214|What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
p295_166|He is willing to pay the required amount.
p295_048|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p295_046|I'm sure he didn't mean it.
p295_373|The voices told me to do it.
p295_241|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
p295_339|However, that could alter following the latest case.
p295_227|We don't have any senior players.
p295_029|It has been supremely successful.
p295_145|He's working hard on that right now.
p295_071|We would have looked out for each other.
p295_152|We are right at the heart of Europe.
p295_129|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
p295_106|This has been a terrible experience.
p295_389|The team is in division one in Spain.
p295_073|Where does he go from here?
p295_383|Our proposals are fully costed.
p295_197|If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.
p295_347|Four years is a long time.
p295_116|I have no plans to retire.
p295_080|People are already enjoying it.
p295_360|But that is entirely a matter for them.
p295_410|To me, it was just a miracle.
p295_255|When we started the album.
p295_288|WE live in a world of large numbers.
p295_391|Our position is not a logic of war.
p295_329|These findings are vitally important.
p295_247|Next league matches, Dundee United - Motherwell.
p295_121|This is a test of our character.
p295_070|He's right up to a point.
p295_199|My intentions are to go on like this.
p295_155|I'm sure they will be very happy.
p295_216|I don't know how they make the weight.
p295_064|It is, after all, a very funny play.
p295_384|We all started running forward.
p295_050|He declined to give further details.
p295_141|I got very, very tired.
p295_186|I'm sure it will go on.
p295_065|Can you imagine a world without design?
p295_225|Parole is a decision for me.
p295_365|Our traditions and culture remain the same.
p295_324|It will not work in our favour.
p295_059|I knew there was a challenge for me.
p295_096|We recognise it as a key area.
p295_292|Anyone can still win this tournament.
p295_301|It was not being marketed properly.
p295_053|For sure we want to win it.
p295_424|There is still the question of his health.
p361_139|It has to find out what went wrong.
p295_039|I think he was nervous to begin with.
p295_099|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p295_355|He is very much in our thoughts.
p361_054|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p295_342|I believe in public services.
p295_237|We have seen the failure of politics.
p295_094|I'm not thinking too much about the tour.
p295_298|Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
p295_072|I had no choice but to leave.
p295_359|You are always aware of the injury potential.
p295_263|It was seriously unpleasant.
p295_303|They know their son was murdered.
p295_282|He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p295_154|I remember it clearly.
p295_165|This is great news - a wonderful addition to the programme.
p374_375|The mood was euphoric.
p295_044|It is just like any other club.
p295_107|He had a different agenda entirely.
p295_164|The voters are our masters.
p295_112|It is reform in return for resources.
p295_098|The time of judgment has arrived.
p295_356|So what could be better than becoming captain?
p295_036|She asked me for the appointment with me.
p295_077|He said, My own position is quite simple.
p295_400|He's close friend of Gordon Brown.
p295_113|It offers a different viewpoint.
p295_366|I decided not to renew the contract.
p295_377|I'm astonished by this decision.
p295_371|She makes me feel very proud.
p295_194|Defeat is simply not an option.
p295_317|It's a member of your family.
p295_398|It was very lucky no-one was killed.
p295_221|This is the best moment of my career.
p295_211|Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.
p295_041|I'm sure he would love it.
p295_284|He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
p295_362|One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
p295_081|We're just delighted to be back on top.
p295_108|Casualties are a problem for the Kremlin.
p295_296|We're not really commenting on that.
p295_411|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
p295_260|But it was the sensible thing to do.
p374_031|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p295_132|I can't see myself in one of those.
p252_067|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
p252_099|They prepared some food very quickly.
p252_258|It was an accident.
p252_211|Their bodies were never found.
p252_371|He said legal action could be considered.
p252_379|That could be ready within another nine months.
p252_374|These matters can't just be medical decisions.
p252_025|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
p252_308|We have achieved that.
p252_126|Gold admitted as much.
p252_221|The labour side had developed in the North area.
p361_189|Now he is back on top again.
p252_184|It is actually building on the existing business.
p252_284|Oil stocks also provided a boost.
p252_233|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
p252_113|It gets too much.
p252_339|Because I think it's there.
p252_270|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
p252_037|Instead, we make the ground pay.
p252_365|Analysts welcomed the news.
p252_036|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
p252_325|Murray plays down return
p252_232|It's used by Ayr Technical College.
p252_300|Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
s5_139|We're currently looking at the level of support.
p252_171|That apart, though, I feel good.
p252_213|Business will continue as usual.
p252_109|We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
p252_353|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
p252_085|LET there be light.
p252_242|When I was training.
p252_282|Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
p252_125|He is at peace with himself.
p252_400|We will miss him against Celtic.
p252_236|There is a good reason for this.
p252_054|Schools will not want change.
p252_364|Still, I am delighted.
p252_390|I'm not sure that's right.
p252_065|These figures cover the major British banking groups.
p252_139|It should have its own network.
p252_227|Her death is a huge blow.
p252_321|We lost to a poor team.
p252_393|There's nothing natural left.
p252_362|He was a great human being.
p252_131|Britain's role was to stop it.
p252_290|Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
p252_094|The car driver died.
p252_047|That's what set him apart.
p252_147|I am never fully fit.
p252_045|The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
p252_055|I think I'm a bit too young.
p252_106|And so it went on.
p252_168|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
p252_292|His season started this afternoon.
p252_344|It was the September weekend after all.
p252_117|That is the only way to rate players.
p252_228|The global market was about flat.
p252_066|Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
p252_217|The Boys can speak about little else.
p252_367|You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
p252_319|One finding emerged clearly.
p252_323|We have clearly become well established.
p252_391|I've kept him in touch with everything.
p252_030|Schools do not create that.
p252_101|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
p252_305|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
p252_302|So does every industry.
p252_181|Parents do not know very much about drugs.
p252_370|The whole system is too complex.
p252_234|We know the problems.
p252_222|Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
p252_185|Maybe this battle had been.
p252_342|They will now remain split up.
p252_112|There was no reason.
p252_142|That shows the impact it had.
p252_295|Kenny and I are ready.
p252_061|The fifth was found later.
p252_268|But the next day she paid for it.
p252_407|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
p252_266|Look at a computer.
p252_383|I got dropped for that game.
p252_283|It is a dangerous sport.
p252_082|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick?
p252_179|I knew Donald Dewar.
p252_162|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
p252_316|Motherwell took them from half chances.
p252_243|I did let myself down a bit.
p252_352|No sport needs that sort of thing.
p252_116|They need the money.
p252_209|The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
p252_250|Our focus remains on quality revenue.
p252_176|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
p252_051|She continued to enjoy sport.
p252_297|He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
p252_225|Now the door has opened.
p252_248|We have several options.
p252_310|Good players have become bad.
p252_278|Paul never gave up hope.
p252_026|This would include insurance.
p252_136|Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
p252_188|London remained the favourite.
p252_057|We wish to win, but not at any price.
p252_263|He makes time for everyone.
p252_401|I managed to do that.
p252_382|He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
p252_167|It wasn't a pretty match.
p252_053|By all accounts he was delighted.
p252_360|They had better be.
p252_165|They have shown great character.
p252_130|I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
p252_354|Any increase always has some effect.
s5_316|The future might well be green after all.
p252_304|But there's also a love for the songs.
p252_084|He has a real potential.
p252_034|I have every confidence.
p252_087|Scotland has great assets.
p252_397|He has worked hard over the years.
p252_044|Something old something new, as it were.
p252_088|That remains the same.
p252_141|But this wasn't the full picture.
p252_314|If a service doesn't pay it will go.
p252_389|The women are victims here.
p252_074|Insurance will perhaps reduce.
p252_333|But it won't help British farmers.
p252_363|That seems highly unlikely.
p252_309|Their eyes, however, told a different story.
p252_262|So we kept them waiting.
p252_123|They pointed to the site.
p252_062|For a decade she was proved right.
p252_069|It would have to be.
p252_345|He would add value.
p252_380|Next league matches Kilmarnock.
p252_384|No real attempt was made to get orders.
p252_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
p252_395|There's always a case.
p252_303|Tomorrow will be my last.
p252_267|He did better then.
p252_058|I agree with you about this.
p252_145|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
p252_027|It would fit very well with us.
p252_052|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
p252_348|That was our last chance to do something.
p252_260|My goals have never changed.
p252_340|If we get the wrong candidate.
p252_177|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
p252_144|I'd always wanted to act.
p252_114|So they should be.
p252_410|All the dead were believed to have been French.
p252_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows.
p252_274|The long-term trend is equally clear.
p252_279|Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
p252_369|Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
p252_215|Fine, said the press officer.
p252_256|It is very much in the eye of the individual.
p252_399|It was too difficult.
p252_271|This was the perfect setting.
p252_128|Evidence must not be held back.
p252_251|Perhaps it will happen again.
p252_396|The new manager must make tough decisions.
p252_349|Maybe she is right.
s5_320|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
p252_059|Or so he thought.
p364_136|But he's a very quiet man.
p364_217|It's happened, but it's a dream.
p364_160|He has gone back to school.
p364_031|But at the moment there isn't the budget.
p364_195|Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
p364_230|There is nothing wrong with that.
p364_306|Sub Not Used, McKee.
p364_221|I had no choice.
p364_270|For many, it had become a fact of life.
p364_211|I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
p364_034|The man has already had too many chances.
p364_263|I've seen it work already.
p364_145|It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
p364_273|It's great fun to get to act.
p364_232|What do you do?
p364_142|I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
p364_126|The money all appears to be gone.
p364_099|He liked to talk.
p364_107|We are not leaving the area.
p364_035|It shouldn't be a problem.
p364_301|Is he any good?
p364_280|We have to get on with it.
p364_206|It is suitable and sensible.
p364_184|So it was in politics.
p364_090|Nature will not find its own level.
p364_059|The family is so happy for him.
p364_105|This is a horrible loss.
p364_238|We just do not do it.
p364_027|That would be a big step forward.
p364_040|I thought it was the only way out.
p364_258|We deserved to get the victory today.
p364_287|It does and it doesn't.
p364_277|And now he has decided, enough.
p364_046|So what did he do?
p364_092|But this has already been rejected.
p364_115|We don't know what is happening to them.
p364_285|I certainly hope so.
p364_116|It's an old story.
p364_272|It was a definite penalty.
p364_282|It would be dangerous to resign.
p364_248|It was something special.
p364_212|I can handle the pace.
p364_225|We just have to improve.
p364_159|Mr Blair defended his wife.
p364_154|Everyone would have been happy.
p364_303|It was then that Rangers scored.
p364_241|That is our business.
p364_123|One is too many.
p364_100|Lots of others were doing the same.
p364_192|Despite that, it was a great day for me.
p364_065|It's not going to work.
p364_063|It is not the fault of one man, of course.
p364_208|I am really, really happy.
p364_174|This has been fantastic.
p364_152|It is an absolute disgrace.
p364_036|It was very moving, actually.
p364_251|It was really surprising.
p364_177|It's very very frustrating.
p364_087|I support the stand that they are making.
p364_269|Or so we thought.
p364_236|Thankfully they liked it.
p364_187|The matter has been reported to the police.
p364_054|There is no doubt about that.
p364_268|I have got to keep the lid on.
p364_074|This was a massive result for us.
p364_278|Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
p364_203|I've got nothing to say.
p364_091|I didn't have the choice.
p364_279|He made no comment.
p364_292|I was the willing journeyman.
p364_149|It's a good story.
p364_309|We're talking to him.
p364_032|It is not a matter of concern.
p364_253|But this is just the first step.
p364_218|I had a son.
p364_223|It would also delay the Scottish results.
p364_215|I believe it would have been successful.
p364_293|I know we ask a lot of you.
p364_098|This is a one-off.
p364_151|It was too soon.
p364_242|We were completely outplayed.
p364_281|He was at the game, and he is indeed.
p364_121|It is part of their job.
p364_041|We welcome the ministers decision.
p364_045|And that's the trouble with this business.
p364_300|I really want to win in Glasgow.
p364_153|I don't think it is the case.
p364_119|I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
p364_233|And there are some interesting conductors, too.
p364_193|I would say the risk is very small.
p364_199|On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
p364_133|He will be fine.
p364_254|We can do it.
p364_143|It is sponsored by The Herald.
p364_089|But was it really so big?
p364_246|I believe in having difficult times.
p364_118|It has been a great success.
p364_038|PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
p364_130|The timing is wrong.
p364_128|This time, it was not be.
p364_061|No-one knows the numbers.
p364_109|Success in Scotland is important.
p364_079|He wanted to talk to me about it.
p364_299|You will be very, very welcome.
p364_043|The concept is simple.
p364_055|The president took offence.
p364_124|What can you say?
p364_172|We must do that.
p364_243|The car driver was not injured.
p364_169|I hope that doesn't happen.
p364_234|It was all over for us then.
p364_025|Is that not pathetic?
p364_156|Ferguson had done his homework.
p364_030|Prime minister Blair is not that way.
p364_127|He was extremely ill.
p364_214|We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
p364_039|I was not fit enough and it showed.
p364_204|It requires a wider team.
p364_157|He deserved that much.
p364_053|I can live with that.
p364_266|This could be the case.
p364_222|What do you do.
p364_141|New investment will be openly tendered.
p364_294|When he got up he was hit again.
p364_265|Israeli forces denied the claim.
p364_037|It isn't a free-for-all.
p364_231|I could not believe the results.
p364_178|We want him to continue that way.
p364_197|The hearing continues today.
p364_051|There will be no disruption in the schools.
p364_070|They've got more time.
p364_082|No-one has spoken to me.
p364_305|I chose the former.
p364_255|This is as bad as it gets.
p364_097|He felt there was no case to answer.
p364_173|England will be under a lot of pressure.
p364_283|It is a victory to that extent.
p364_298|It's going to be tough.
p364_262|It would be a bonus for this game.
p364_155|It has paid off.
p364_194|And there are different perspectives.
p364_165|I really feel sorry for the Irish.
p364_261|It does not take much.
p364_033|We're not either of those things.
p364_213|I am happy to be here.
p364_122|This decision is a victory for common sense.
p364_189|We do know the reaction of the SAC.
p364_205|It is so beautiful.
p364_188|We are at war.
p364_227|This is very good news.
p364_297|It was just one man.
p364_210|I'm not interested in money.
p364_094|They have not seen her for years.
p364_276|It goes in cycles.
p364_240|It had happened to him.
p364_096|Allison is not convinced.
p364_050|What do you think they said?
p364_304|This was repeated the second time.
p364_219|It was very, very frightening.
p364_252|It was a nightmare.
p364_162|I don't know where it went.
p364_308|They were very responsive.
p364_226|It hasn't worked out that way.
p225_037|In fact, they are the future of investment.
p225_171|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
p225_057|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p225_056|Clearly, it can go either way.
p225_318|The problem was he thought you were a big man.
p225_166|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
p225_065|There is no pressure on us.
p225_035|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
p225_040|You'd better believe it.
p225_202|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
p225_103|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
p225_173|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
p225_133|I think he's the favourite.
p225_287|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
p225_117|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
p225_182|We are just glad to be alive.
p225_219|They did not attack the themes of the book.
p225_297|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
p225_266|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p225_274|We have not reached the point of no return.
p225_174|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
p225_038|Diving is no part of football.
p225_316|It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
p225_120|The industry is not well organised.
p225_084|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
p225_356|I said he was set to retire.
p226_059|She's a spy!
p226_183|I have no sympathy with her at all.
p226_113|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
p226_033|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
p226_088|Detection is often difficult.
p232_178|It's the real thing, for sure.
p232_253|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p232_200|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p232_291|They were also beside themselves.
p232_119|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
p232_262|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
s5_345|In fact, he is very much a Kilmarnock man.
s5_341|The sale of Murray Johnstone should be completed early in the fourth quarter.
s5_160|We have never met a previous Prime Minister.
s5_249|However, Hamilton had a different version of events.
s5_255|But I'm a lot of other things, too.
s5_397|New York provided little help for the London market.
s5_381|They wanted them to move fast, but some couldn't.
s5_203|I think every coach wants to work daily.
s5_248|Private sector pay awards were a major factor.
s5_175|I'm just as concerned about life and death as you are.
s5_327|You get better at putting on a face for the world.
s5_306|Or we could do a trade sale.
s5_349|Local and national phone calls will be free.
s5_049|The full price was accepted by them.
s5_205|The hotel has a long and happy history.
s5_382|Jones said she was there to show my complete support for my husband.
s5_066|The group is currently working to create several substantial new funds.
s5_246|We are delighted  nothing else, just delighted.
s5_303|The Russian described his defeat as a bad day at the office.
s5_238|He is not quite as confident as he appears.
s5_144|It was also live on Radio Five.
s5_253|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
s5_166|But, overall, Aberdeen looks well placed for growth.
s5_385|Lead feet were the order of the day.
s5_279|I am convinced that this is a subject which can make a difference.
s5_317|The package of measures and extra cash are a major step forward.
s5_302|I would not want to be famous for nothing.
s5_074|I can understand fully that Rangers and Celtic want to progress.
s5_182|They were mainly very positive about the role.
s5_055|I said My brother, George, never saw that.
s5_067|We're moving from four companies into a single company.
s5_222|It is vital that the government gets this right.
s5_179|Glasgow has continued to run it on an agency basis.
s5_086|The campaign ran in Lothian, Fife and Central Scotland police areas.
s5_394|This trial has brought the focus back on the inquiry.
s5_107|I felt my father was very hard.
s5_321|In short, he is the wrong candidate, but the right man.
s5_237|But the town has great potential as a book town.
s5_190|In this position, it often takes some time.
s5_193|I expect to see a different Kilmarnock side tomorrow.
s5_340|That has been the story all through this season, really.
s5_242|What are you not good at ?
s5_129|We have never been paid that money.
s5_168|He's a man who knows all about forward thinking.
s5_050|When you do you will never want to do any other job.
s5_383|Like some others, he is still to improve himself a lot.
s5_347|Stewart ruled out a return of this cash to shareholders, however.
s5_304|Mitchell hit a post from a penalty in front.
s5_154|We are too easily beaten as a team.
s5_358|In football terms, though, Kilmarnock are well in the black.
s5_357|Two goals in nine minutes wasn't bad.
s5_072|The management team has a hard task ahead.
s5_109|I think we can cause a surprise in the first division.
s5_247|We will be taking a world lead.
s5_028|On his first public appearance, Mr Cameron found himself under fire.
s5_240|Does the name matter ?
s5_053|But you have to give credit to Dunfermline.
s5_395|That had happened long before half-time yesterday.
s5_325|People are determined to get it right.
s5_167|The site was launched in the UK on Monday.
s5_361|Life will not be all work, however.
s5_111|We backed away from writing new songs.
s5_228|We have to look towards next season.
s5_091|It is no longer the white death.
s5_218|But not every story is a success story.
s5_089|Offers of company cars and other benefits have also become quite common.
s5_126|In our view the stock has financial risk.
s5_208|An English Parliament was never a serious option.
s5_171|I was told that I've set that new club scoring record.
s5_068|It is too much to take in.
s5_266|He did not provide us with a proposal.
s5_365|The Farmer is doing the whole of August.
s5_355|It's always a difficult game against England.
s5_120|There were no reports of any injuries.
s5_035|I got in with a bad crowd.
s5_272|The only plus point is the reduction in crime.
s5_244|Overall, though, it was an easy Sunday afternoon for Kilmarnock.
s5_100|It's hardly a new strategy in art practice.
s5_115|The potential is always in the idea.
s5_346|Perhaps we should learn something from them.
s5_216|It would not have thought otherwise for one moment.
s5_087|Tony Blair is taking a computer course.
s5_221|This result has given me much food for thought.
s5_057|First Choice is the clear leader in terms of performance.
s5_319|We can get back on track with that.
s5_092|When I went down I knew it was bad.
s5_217|We've had five weeks with two games really.
s5_245|A Home Office spokeswoman said she was unable to comment on individual cases.
s5_095|Woods is not just in control of his golf game.
s5_267|But I was not up for the title.
s5_084|Campbell said he hoped to build on that fighting spirit against Hearts.
s5_043|For career reasons, too, he believed he needed to come home.
s5_370|Most of the affected jobs are in the US.
s5_186|But I hope the referee can now go back on his decision.
s5_293|The group has been hit hard by security operations in Ireland.
s5_214|It is not a natural choice for them.
s5_189|Clubs need to have their own drug abuse policies.
s5_323|We even changed the system three times but it didn't help.
s5_296|Some analysts said a share split seemed likely.
s5_187|This will take in dividend policy and capital structure.
s5_108|Once again a strong services performance helped the overall trading position.
s5_309|Their job is to show whether any disease remains.
s5_196|I had several words with the fourth official and was warned.
s5_313|I was better prepared than a year ago.
s5_259|I enjoyed this summer, which is a big difference from last year.
s5_197|Opera must get its house in order
s5_360|Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the American university, confirmed the appointment yesterday.
s5_338|I am confident that the estate workers will have a secure future.
s5_048|I can live here without a problem.
s5_268|His own boys say the same about him.
s5_106|Britain will lead demands for the reform of Europe.
s5_093|It's allowed in the rules he said later.
s5_372|The two cases are about exactly the same thing.
s5_141|Getting Kilmarnock so early in the Scottish season could give us a chance.
s5_326|We are putting in place training programmes to improve skills.
s5_234|There was no plan B if the Good Friday Agreement failed, he warned.
s5_119|It has too few of its own special forces inside Kosovo.
s5_226|People like him give rugby a good name.
s5_112|We control every part of your life.
s5_137|It is a dangerous trip to make for these people.
s5_236|His home is provided by the government.
s5_158|The property has been for sale for several months.
s5_163|South Africa is the next likely customer.
s5_241|how do you get it back ?
s5_117|Six public bodies are behind the plan.
s5_291|If he could have taken those words back, he would have.
s5_298|Consumers have generally accepted this process to date.
s5_054|However, a year ago things looked so different.
s5_371|None of the fire has been lost.
s5_344|This may help in the short term but not beyond March.
s5_114|The balance comes from the five enterprise bodies involved.
s5_379|But the German product failed safety tests.
s5_352|Neither issued any statement after the hearing.
s5_283|Larsson is clearly the form player just now.
s5_056|At the present moment, she will stay.
s5_261|Even if it did, my views wouldn't change.
s5_353|And so it is with young companies.
s5_176|You can see the damage that has been done.
s5_151|So on the stadium front, I think we have made our case.
s5_233|I know that you have a love of Scotland.
p236_377|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p236_260|It is very hard for her.
p236_425|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
p236_159|It's not like us.
p236_050|I haven't been ill at all.
p236_437|He said current trading was strong.
p236_477|Analysts said the offer was fair.
p236_161|It is not a financial issue.
p236_410|He may have a point.
p236_348|The confidence isn't there now.
p236_482|Winning a medal is a dream.
p236_278|We have the moral high ground.
p236_323|A lot has been written.
p236_198|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p236_166|He is not a team captain.
p236_280|It has all been done in secret.
p236_053|We keep an eye on it.
p236_467|It can all be done over the phone.
p236_381|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
p236_391|The following day I used the story.
p236_424|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
p236_167|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
p236_403|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
p236_319|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
p236_490|I had it before the final.
p236_390|She is in their hands.
p236_388|It brought in new management.
p230_378|We are a Scottish company.
p236_493|I would put my money on Peter Donald.
p236_433|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
p236_409|I would love to think that she could win.
p236_419|They were not complacent in any way.
p236_262|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
p230_057|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p236_029|It's going to have a hell of an effect.
p236_418|I think it's a miracle.
p236_495|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
p236_422|The fate of the rest is unknown.
p236_486|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
p236_252|It's important to get it right.
p236_146|He could do nothing about it.
p236_440|But by that time, it was too late.
p236_462|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
p236_195|As many as the market will support.
p236_474|He was a shooting star.
p236_487|We have to go for a win.
p236_451|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
p236_120|The colours are very pretty.
p236_489|Something has got to change.
p236_336|That decision has already been made.
p236_465|I was all image and no substance.
p236_484|That is the bottom line.
p236_459|Dennis was not so sure.
p236_312|It was really very frightening.
p236_199|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
p236_121|He is a lovely man.
p236_085|Change will however have to be in euros.
p236_052|That was the difference today.
p236_430|We've got a good management record.
p236_084|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
p236_457|And she is very clear on this.
p236_439|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
p236_270|But they were never expected to last.
p236_102|It became difficult for me.
p362_168|People also have trouble with the currency.
p362_176|Only two players have done it.
p362_134|The building was starting to come down.
p362_356|They will do something big.
p362_030|But there are no plans.
p362_362|The same goes for Russia.
p362_188|I thought he was at fault.
p362_147|I don't think we deserved to lose.
p362_291|Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
p362_121|It's always the way.
p362_302|But we all have to look at ourselves.
p362_037|It's not Big Brother at sea.
p362_340|O no it's not!
p362_110|There have been so many.
p362_373|We should not be complacent.
p362_137|There is a subtle difference.
p362_172|That is for certain.
p362_050|But this was refused.
p362_198|Do what you want to do.
p362_211|I was so relieved.
p362_418|As indeed it did.
p362_222|Are you up for business?
p362_255|We are in a very strong position.
p362_344|He was their leader.
p362_380|We are not getting him back.
p362_108|I know he meant it.
p362_232|That had never happened.
p362_248|In saying that, you just have to get on with it.
p362_055|He is one of them.
p362_063|Policing the profession is important.
p362_074|She's afraid of life.
p362_195|I never had any real direction at school.
p362_197|It is quite a young team, so the future is there.
p362_397|Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.
p362_120|The fire was still coming down.
p362_374|We all want the same things.
p362_069|It's more relaxing this way.
p323_251|Maybe they will show it next year.
p362_158|However, the story has a happy ending.
p362_337|It was quite an ordeal for them.
p362_286|He will not be coming back.
p362_329|The process itself has taken over.
p362_322|I don't think it's very real.
p362_297|There will be new memories.
p362_271|This is not a crisis.
p362_065|She had no chance.
p362_266|He's a great dealer.
p362_279|Sad to say, it's still waiting.
p362_417|I had no idea.
p362_128|I had never done anything like it before.
p362_212|They continue to do so.
p362_399|That is why he is so special.
p323_090|You are not in any kind of trouble.
p362_122|I got the surprise of my life.
p362_126|I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
p362_075|But there is good and bad.
p362_210|What do you want to say?
p362_175|That is not, however, the case.
p306_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p306_192|These elements are in the book.
p306_314|It was just completely erased.
p306_304|We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.
p306_181|It was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p306_293|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.
p306_215|If we live forever, can we be said to live?
p306_259|It's the stop-gap before extinction.
p306_307|They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p306_060|We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.
p306_027|This is not an amnesty.
p306_019|Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p306_230|This is all part of being opening the door.
p306_222|It was a stunning drive from Jon.
p306_058|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
p306_066|He also does not get on with Christina.
p306_290|This is a young team, you know.
p306_082|It is truly fields of miracles.
p306_188|The faith of large numbers remain unknown.
p306_177|It shows that we are a civilised society.
p306_319|I tend to not look back.
p306_155|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
p306_178|It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.
p306_206|It was turning that way all across Europe.
p323_241|Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
p323_282|It all changes for her.
p323_422|I wish it well.
p323_106|We are not dealing here with refugees.
p323_042|What is next?
p323_329|I didn't know there was anything wrong.
p323_062|This is the place to play football.
p323_286|We remain confident that Danny is still alive.
p323_086|It's an interesting debate to get going.
p323_137|Everything was a dead end.
p323_285|We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
p323_355|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p323_342|Everyone thought they were safe.
p323_084|And, within itself, it is visionary.
p323_026|Film music was never the same again.
p323_260|There is nothing sinister in it.
p323_061|It is very difficult.
p323_255|Thankfully, for me, the matter is now closed.
p323_179|In the eyes of the supporters, there has been a betrayal.
p323_322|But it wasn't to be.
p323_144|New blood is essential for progress.
p323_353|At the same time it is a satire.
p323_096|There is no conflict of interest.
p323_184|It would be difficult to argue with that.
p323_321|My mother was getting on at me.
p323_188|Rather than just a way in, she begins with an entrance.
p323_270|What do you think of the hair?
p323_125|I have been to see him.
p323_027|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
p323_397|Of course he does!
p323_030|This is the best way to do it.
p323_266|I was not happy about being left out.
p323_307|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p323_034|Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.
p323_325|Then there is the terrain.
p323_216|Lack of pace is his big problem.
p323_248|These are exciting times for young Scottish players.
p323_058|We didn't try hard enough, that is all.
p323_396|That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.
p323_406|A decision about that will be made today.
p323_149|I said, What does this mean?
p323_040|They were not up to speed.
p323_049|So, what's it about?
p323_263|It is having a big impact.
p323_073|I mean they have just been a disaster.
p323_136|I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.
p323_134|It was no more than they deserved.
p323_053|How well did they get on?
p323_059|It also condemned the suicide bombers.
p323_083|These things just happen.
p323_116|No passengers were on board.
p323_182|He was married with children.
p323_175|We have done a deal with IMPACT.
p323_232|The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.
p323_203|There is no reason to put me out.
p323_257|Are we here?
p323_333|She was totally possessed.
p323_202|She is not in a coma.
p323_377|He asked how they were doing.
p323_299|We were a little bit nervous.
p323_403|We didn't make any of this up.
p323_197|It was a good atmosphere.
p323_242|I went home and wrote about it.
p323_360|This is a critical time for football.
p323_054|I don't think it is a drawback.
p323_037|They discussed how he might get involved.
p323_372|This is totally out of character for Stuart.
p323_056|They may have been murdered.
p323_296|I have never seen anything like it.
p323_118|If it does it means he has failed.
p323_050|We have been let down by these people.
p323_415|The Dutchman was suspended for two games.
p323_032|Leisure centres were also affected.
p323_028|Now it is much easier.
p323_045|The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
p323_343|People wouldn't have quite understood the language.
p323_103|He could look after himself, but didn't.
p323_092|Will they fall out?
p323_363|I think she is supreme.
p323_067|Most of the others were in their twenties.
p323_379|I'll have to work on that.
p323_029|However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.
p323_284|Is it a threat to union?
p323_127|I would never say anything against her.
p323_237|He predicted the contest would be very close.
p323_170|The stakes are high.
p323_293|Maybe his time has gone.
p323_208|Post offices are closing now.
p323_151|We can do both.
p323_327|It's such a shock.
p323_128|He probably would not have added, mainly by me.
p323_101|Club rugby refuses to die.
p323_393|Hours later, she was found dead by Ms Wilson.
p323_380|He must be seen to be impartial.
p323_240|The key issue for us is public safety.
p323_239|My life would be a lot less restrictive.
p323_104|The decision was designed to shock investors.
p323_414|Now it's all written down.
p323_052|Nor does he have any desire to be.
p323_108|I've had a very long run.
p323_420|The commission is not the only loser.
p323_075|That is my personal view.
p323_048|Mackie was at home, unable to watch.
p323_156|They should not have behaved in that way.
p323_041|We know the quality of life goes up.
p323_038|And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
p323_278|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p323_094|He was not able to talk to us.
p374_329|This is great news for us.
p374_076|What method of funding is being used?
p374_219|History is made at the Masters.
p374_096|I'm working at the moment.
p374_345|I have been struggling with my form.
p374_117|I fell in love with it.
p374_353|And that brings us to the point.
p374_266|I am expecting to win.
p374_122|The course is in great condition.
p374_036|I was contacted this morning.
p374_350|We were unlucky not to score.
p374_114|I don't think it would make any difference.
p374_395|I just don't know what she was doing.
p374_068|This time it is official.
p374_060|That took a long time to happen.
p374_245|It is just so sad.
p374_143|I told the players that at half-time.
p374_342|So what is their secret?
p374_385|What's the best thing to do?
p374_051|We have a problem.
p374_183|It was just one of those days.
p374_185|She has been unable to work since.
p374_135|The contest was already over.
p374_314|I am not a threat to coaches.
p374_386|For tragedy it is.
p374_376|I want to get at the truth.
p361_117|He was taken ill in his office.
p374_361|I hope that is the lucky break.
p374_141|Where is the logic in that?
p374_027|The game today is certainly different.
p374_405|They have not given them the evidence.
p374_081|and their remit is limited.
p374_393|They do it properly.
p374_084|There is no question of dithering.
p374_078|This is a great day.
p374_138|It was the only possible decision.
p374_309|This is as bad as it can get.
p374_422|Next year this time  we will be home.
p374_374|This is the goal.
p374_415|Neither could be contacted last night.
p374_276|It is our other home.
p374_362|It is almost like a family.
p374_379|I am not changing my mind.
p374_409|I certainly will not settle.
p374_360|One person had a broken back.
p374_186|No-one has ever seen inside.
p374_126|They went to the press.
p374_278|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
p374_252|It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
p374_179|We have got away with it.
p374_223|I wonder what they listen to?
p374_306|But it has all been worthwhile.
p374_161|It is a step up.
p374_037|He didn't want me to leave the house.
p374_424|It will be crucial.
p374_169|That's the kind of production it was.
p374_134|They are a good team.
p374_121|Paterson was the man.
p374_097|However, this is only the start.
p374_254|This is certainly not the case.
p374_359|It's a good start.
p374_189|Archer is no newcomer to the stage.
p374_065|Where is the discipline?
p374_154|Next league matches Motherwell.
p374_074|That money could have been coming to Scotland.
p374_347|It is coming on very well.
p374_167|I'd never given up on myself.
p374_155|I have been there already.
p374_330|We certainly have to try something.
p374_348|We won't go down without a struggle.
p374_115|They have just got to believe in themselves.
p374_229|That is bad enough.
p374_413|I don't make it mystical.
p374_026|This isn't some form of commission.
p374_277|Where do you start?
p374_327|The biggest thing is structure.
p374_326|We cannot go on like this.
p374_190|It's a matter of time.
p374_336|He has two children.
p374_303|I've already got this.
p374_120|That's not going to happen again.
p374_377|Everyone here is very sad.
p374_402|I will have to think about it.
p374_170|Little girls are his victims.
p374_248|It all depends on the Chancellor.
p374_366|It was a game they could have won.
p374_218|That is just not true.
p374_390|We are all very pleased.
p374_325|It will never happen.
p374_281|We are delighted with that.
p374_241|It's always somebody else's.
p374_075|I'd love to do another Olympics.
p374_136|Does it make a profit?
p374_221|Not so, he insisted.
p374_233|We are very happy with the verdict.
p374_153|But opinion was divided.
p374_175|It is the manager's decision.
p374_149|And so it should.
p374_224|Does a lot of drawing.
p374_128|We are very pleased.
p374_040|I've had a ball.
p374_030|And that was just for starters.
p374_112|It was a sickening sight.
p374_257|Our thoughts are with his family.
p374_157|Scott and Emily were so happy.
p374_269|We don't need to change the law.
p374_338|It was a matter of choice.
p374_272|That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.
p374_312|There was a hell of a row.
p374_232|We need to think.
p374_204|It was so unfair.
p374_045|As a player you have to move on.
p374_038|It's not just a challenge for us.
p374_113|We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.
p374_178|There's no reason for panic.
p374_116|If that is not a warning, what is it?
p374_346|That was about it.
p374_397|You can't have both.
p374_163|However, it is not all bad news for women.
p374_125|It's up to them.
p374_174|The statement was a lie.
p374_404|Well, you can't have everything.
p374_333|What is that?
p374_418|And well he might.
p374_235|For once it wasn't about money.
p374_237|That doesn't happen in Europe.
p374_288|I had a good life at Rangers.
p374_251|It was not pretty.
p374_297|I don't know them or anything.
p374_323|It really is good to be back.
p374_049|His condition was serious but stable.
p374_273|We can only do that for so long.
p374_365|My game is coming back.
p374_416|That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
p374_368|It is a matter for Westminster.
p374_047|I am inclined to play it down.
p374_058|The net is closing.
p374_292|Just a year later he was dead.
p361_031|I decided it is going to be William.
p361_254|It came in bits and pieces.
p361_391|Everything is coming together well.
p361_044|I'm sure he does.
p361_369|This is a major step forward.
p361_413|That can benefit the larger companies.
p361_093|I knew him a little.
p361_374|This is good news for the industry.
p361_152|This series is for real.
p361_410|It has a rally instead of a conference.
p361_421|My life is going to go on.
p361_078|As it should be.
p361_320|I have some comments.
p361_423|That was only the start.
p361_276|That is one point of view.
p361_193|That is clearly not happening fast enough.
p361_383|Conditions were less than ideal.
p361_148|Or someone wants to say something different.
p361_244|Sadly it is a mess.
p361_248|However we must not be complacent.
p361_074|They said there was nothing.
p361_385|Father is on the train.
p361_105|It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
p361_314|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p361_218|But we were wrong.
p361_324|We are very proud of him.
p361_357|We had no idea what was going on.
p361_359|So far, it is no more.
p361_272|So what is the secret of the success?
p361_229|I just want him to win a tournament.
p361_029|The results were very clear.
p361_172|It is a very demanding course.
p361_221|It is a performance.
p361_160|That is the sensible outcome.
p361_181|That's not the way to think.
p361_065|I thought it was quite a positive result.
p361_292|It was considered to be topical.
p361_226|Part-time staff are being laid off.
p361_282|Indeed, that has already begun.
p361_079|We have never been short of volunteers.
p361_116|You should enjoy the day.
p361_083|It just isn't there.
p361_388|Firstly, we don't know we can do this.
p361_161|You can see the appeal of running away.
p361_356|I did not go looking anywhere else.
p361_263|Do something that we need.
p361_347|This is still happening in the US.
p361_252|Colour is another problem.
p361_171|We can't go on like this.
p361_135|It will have to ratify the deal.
p361_045|He was found again almost a year later.
p361_211|It is his script.
p361_157|Something has to be put in place.
p361_179|They get money for it now.
p361_199|People are trying to run away.
p361_299|Again, there was no detail.
p361_049|I am the fastest player on the course.
p361_198|It was just a feeling.
p361_375|There are no quick fixes.
p361_294|No-one is a winner in this.
p361_069|He said it was for sale.
p361_325|There they were, making excuses for him.
p361_101|He knows he is good.
p361_132|That got me out.
p361_336|When you think you cannot go on, you can.
p361_034|I am really ready for it now.
p361_371|Well, you don't have time.
p361_353|That there would be discussions.
p361_265|When she returned, it was a wreck.
p361_138|We needed someone and we now have him.
p361_220|It is an outrage.
p361_418|It is a result we should savour.
p361_337|What a difference a game can make.
p361_090|I was saying, No.
p361_202|He should be careful.
p361_258|He will appear in court today.
p361_328|It's all about unfinished business.
p361_115|This could easily have been another tragedy.
p361_057|That was something else.
p361_342|It's just not good enough.
p361_053|It is an important step forward.
p361_318|It doesn't look good for her.
p361_245|That has to take its toll.
p361_112|Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.
p361_121|It is just a statement of fact.
p361_234|He knew they were there.
p361_201|This is clearly not abuse.
p361_280|I can't wait for it to come out.
p361_264|There is no other offer on the table.
p361_119|Cost is a factor, but not the only one.
p361_169|Then there's the casting.
p361_255|You don't see that.
p361_355|That would be unsafe.
p361_056|That is the way it is.
p361_185|We want to be part of it.
p361_184|There was nothing she could do.
p361_256|They seem to be, anyway.
p361_327|Every case is completely different.
p361_348|And that was the real problem.
p361_301|Then it will come.
p361_266|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p361_176|If they wish to go, they can go.
p361_275|It is still under discussion with the board.
p361_113|He is a pro.
p361_323|Not that he was complaining.
p361_406|It is truly masterly performance.
p361_213|The response was really good.
p361_259|Or is he?
p361_415|We told them in July.
p361_208|The pace is telling.
p361_296|What do you think?
p361_038|And this was well known?
p361_322|There was nowhere for him to go.
p361_285|And he did that.
p361_297|They went back to the seventeenth.
p361_114|They have to tell it as it is.
p361_224|There were other problems for Brown yesterday.
p361_253|It is not just the agencies.
p361_166|Those are difficult decisions.
p361_257|I thought they were just excited.
p361_212|I am a socialist.
p361_240|Four of the victims were women.
p361_419|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p361_128|We've always had something to do.
p361_175|I've won the British.
p361_164|And so did the rest of her team.
p361_417|We are very, very confident.
p361_349|But then the problems began.
p361_123|I will just have to be patient.
p361_281|I am really sorry that he is going.
p361_141|I'm sure he will be aware of it.
p361_242|It's to do with this place.
p361_107|Music is all consuming.
p361_215|You can blame the defence.
p361_068|We are not going to back off.
p361_358|If only it had been.
p361_200|On the face of it, this is excellent news.
p361_145|She has never mentioned it.
p361_106|I've done a lot in that building.
p361_111|I'm not looking forward to it.
p361_082|Workers will now be balloted on the offer.
p361_194|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p361_298|If we don't do it, someone else will.
p361_329|Our own people are coming over on Friday.
p361_235|That would end it for us.
p361_147|It seems to have been an own goal.
p361_206|We will be working on that this week, all right.
p361_365|I don't think so.
p361_368|It is really special to me.
p361_102|I welcome the decision.
p361_333|He has a point.
p361_094|They just have a go.
p361_262|It's been very difficult.
p361_217|It just could be a good night.
p361_122|It was on my mind a little bit.
p361_180|I could have been offended.
p361_143|They received no money under the merger.
p361_300|Let the voters decide.
p361_134|It's a matter for the Committee.
p361_269|We call it marriage.
p361_232|I will never see my son again.
p361_149|There are no second chances.
p361_183|Then everyone must consider their future.
p361_067|Nobody else is at risk.
p361_317|The concerns were unfounded.
p361_077|I wouldn't give them a grade.
p361_341|And we are doing it.
p361_060|We will be patient but we will win.
p361_364|It's going to happen.
p361_291|I will never forget that.
p361_032|But we need to keep it there.
p361_155|I wish they would commit to us.
p361_026|That is where the damage has been done.
p361_209|She has always been very friendly.
p361_287|His remarks were disgraceful.
p361_096|Nobody called me to explain.
p361_039|It took two minutes to respond.
p361_195|You look at that.
p361_230|Eight others are also believed to have died.
p361_362|He could have given them a lot.
p361_197|It has been well worth it.
p361_173|Can he do it?
p361_260|Was he confident about his prospects?
p361_076|I've got to be better than that   Quite.
p361_370|They haven't got the uniform.
p361_168|The game was there to be won.
p361_308|That is a dangerous assumption.
p361_058|This resulted in the following.
p361_321|You have to be realistic.
p361_352|The duties are still to be drawn up.
p361_238|Neil is never going to come back.
p361_037|This decision is folly.
p361_188|This is positive and welcome.
p361_089|We all want to be left alone.
p361_405|We are going nowhere.
p361_422|It's really part of our mission.
p361_338|It is their day.
p361_339|They are a very good side, without a doubt.
p361_411|I found that we couldn't.
p361_363|It was up to him.
p361_203|Everyone knew the family.
p361_283|But it's the truth.
p361_390|It is planned for London in the spring.
p361_196|They will be very physical.
p361_131|A kind of effective treatment would be welcomed.
p361_344|You've got to hand it to them.
p361_162|This means a lot of hard decisions.
p361_124|I didn't think about it again.
p361_110|Which is where we come in.
p361_351|From the opening Could It Be Magic?
p361_236|We didn't and it cost us the game.
p361_277|We are in this for the long haul.
p361_118|We couldn't get enough of it.
p361_420|We certainly do not intend to disband.
p361_396|They thought they couldn't get any.
p361_140|Only one was from Glasgow.
p361_247|But those days are dead and gone.
p361_223|We tried to get them down.
p361_061|As good as they come.
p361_108|The results are very positive.
p361_080|But who is it?
p361_097|You didn't get a modified.
p361_278|Here we go then.
p361_249|And that was just the start.
p361_167|The omens are not good.
p361_366|And that was just about that.
p361_251|That was my last game.
p361_130|It will be released in October.
p361_412|He is very sensitive.
p361_233|But it is being pursued.
p361_125|And if they fail?
p361_040|Why you did it will never be known.
p361_059|I want to deal with this stuff.
p361_271|It's not the tour.
p361_304|I will build a house on the site.
p361_284|We have been here before.
p361_178|I was just aghast.
p361_241|He was also very happy to listen.
p361_191|Anything less will not do.
p361_386|It could have been prevented.
p361_237|It attracted no complaints.
p361_075|They were looking for things.
p361_025|Something has to be done.
p361_216|Usually the enjoyment is two ways.
p361_379|It's about New Yorkers.
p361_400|She had denied the charge.
p361_046|The answer was wrong.
p361_153|It has still to be recovered.
p361_268|He is not the only one.
p361_052|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p361_340|They are used to it.
p361_051|They were taken to prove a point.
p361_372|It is very funny.
p361_345|Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.
p361_330|In Scotland, there should be vigilance.
p361_047|They need to be helped.
p361_084|Drama is not one of them.
p361_062|It is not for me to say.
p361_424|But what took them so long?
p361_373|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p361_137|It was highly successful.
p361_072|The problem is not confined to the UK.
p361_331|It will be fine.
p361_289|I have really noticed that this week.
p361_326|It just got out of control.
p361_393|But we are not afraid of them.
p361_210|Their loss is heartbreaking.
p361_279|No reason was given.
p361_398|I am delighted to have her back home.
p361_156|The driver just insulted me.
p361_382|He certainly would have approved.
p361_095|If it's going in, it goes in.
p361_354|It must not happen.
p361_288|I did not think it was very proper.
p361_071|This is a dream come true.
p361_088|It's just a failing service.
p361_293|Well, that's all right then.
p361_377|What do we have to do?
p361_315|They are already there.
p361_399|This idea is a good starting point.
p361_332|Yet the job is far from over.
p361_222|It is the best place.
p361_043|So, we have to go back.
p361_150|And it was great for me.
p361_165|He tells the truth and that's important.
p361_403|What sort of man is that?
p241_165|There was no respite.
p241_271|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p230_145|She has gone to the Catholic school.
p230_241|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
p230_119|But this time we can have no excuses.
p230_244|Here is a question for you.
p230_417|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
p230_375|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
p230_306|Rugby is now just like football.
p230_215|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
p230_061|But the challenge is in the US.
p230_250|We have to compete at our own level.
p230_369|They have broken the promise.
p230_032|The wedding was in Edinburgh.
p230_144|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
p230_078|This is a true story.
p230_120|They are very happy with the new settlement.
p230_356|In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
p230_296|It took a month and a half to film.
p230_169|On the month the weakness was across the board.
p230_289|In that moment, I was happy.
p230_105|It is close to call.
p230_324|We were on our way.
p230_110|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
p230_147|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
p230_232|I was not sure whether I had won.
p230_269|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
p230_373|It's going to be fun.
p230_149|However, he was later released without charge.
p230_406|We're obviously disturbed by this case.
p230_043|The big problem is the lack of grass.
p230_385|If you can get it.
p230_049|We have to bring in new players.
p230_223|How do you get it back?
p230_279|There is a case to answer.
p230_076|Consumer confidence remains an issue.
p230_371|My goal is quite simple.
p230_405|It was a bank holiday, after all.
p230_102|This was a good move for me.
p230_334|It was always an option.
p330_323|The committee's remit is far reaching.
p330_035|There were no reported injuries.
p330_166|It was horrible, but there is still more.
p330_144|Was society doing enough?
p330_068|I think it is a release of tension.
p330_392|She was my big sister.
p330_082|I am here to play football.
p330_417|O Leary now intends to take a holiday.
p330_347|We have to learn lessons from these things.
p330_260|The question is, Is that a negative?
p330_271|For this government, reform and resources go together.
p330_270|That is our main aim.
p330_180|He urged Mr Blair to get out more.
p330_204|She was right about the struggle.
p330_302|Chris is big and jolly.
p330_151|They have worked with each other.
p330_334|What are you waiting for?
p330_026|I was backing him up.
p330_220|Ordering online was very easy.
p330_307|The festival idea has been a great success.
p330_207|I think the euro has slipped.
p330_413|Their welfare is very important to us.
p330_034|They could move in at any moment.
p330_209|I will not take you out of context.
p330_029|That was their attitude.
p330_154|That will alter the dynamics of Scottish politics.
p330_297|That was quite an interesting part.
p330_208|We began to walk down.
p330_363|It is the way they work.
p330_197|Billie was yet to be born.
p330_419|This is about the Orange Order.
p330_242|You would fall over, he said.
p330_200|This is a good result for them.
p330_193|It's not one or the other, you have to have both.
p330_084|That is the crunch.
p330_234|To a level which we consider appropriate.
p330_235|That is the first thing we need.
p330_264|He will decide tomorrow.
p330_191|It has all been positive.
p330_117|The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
p330_357|They might want to play.
p330_306|I do not want to wait until May.
p330_309|We all work for nothing.
p330_396|Then  all was revealed.
p330_361|Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
p330_218|You remember how long he lasted?
p330_090|Everything has the potential to be serious.
p330_246|Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.
p330_030|It was nothing to do with my daughter.
p330_241|We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
p330_257|Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
p330_228|All these women were actors.
p330_240|A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
p330_093|This will be great for the young lads.
p330_251|We must all play our part.
p330_391|He was located after going to Singapore.
p330_038|It is my nature.
p330_112|Wallace was in at the deep end.
p330_183|Euro The single currency is a fact.
p330_135|The reason, of course, was Iraq.
p330_346|She is very upset.
p330_099|There's nothing for the kids.
p330_189|A board of inquiry has already been convened.
p330_358|The goal will stay with me forever.
p330_310|It is extremely popular with families.
p330_077|The problem is Labour.
p330_128|It's much more dynamic.
p330_076|I want to help other women.
p330_216|We are not far from a deal.
p330_100|Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
p330_223|I think it is a great idea.
p330_416|You have to work with what you've got.
p330_105|The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
p330_194|No government has that right.
p330_409|You guys are not out of it yet.
p330_118|Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.
p330_414|It's nothing to do with me.
p330_232|What happened to me last week was wrong.
