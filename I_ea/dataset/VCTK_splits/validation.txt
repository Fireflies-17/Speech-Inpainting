p231_292|I've lost all confidence.
p231_030|That deal is a joke.
p231_364|It is not real life.
p231_203|What are you no good at?
p231_472|He felt it was the right time.
p231_368|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
p231_277|Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
p231_211|They are looking at flotation.
p231_467|Classes must be reduced by half.
p231_394|That's as good as it gets.
p231_121|I was just a child.
p231_070|This is an exciting new venture.
p231_309|He is still in shock.
p231_049|There's nothing we could do about this.
p231_139|Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
p231_353|The units will not be replaced.
p231_040|Last year, I was pretty bad.
p231_330|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
p231_445|It sounded like a bomb.
p231_271|I thought he might have been a bit.
p231_207|You've caught a serial killer.
p231_456|They have to be met.
p231_122|We should not be surprised.
p231_444|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p231_314|I'm not making any comment at all.
p231_416|There is some light in the tunnel.
p231_179|But one was not enough.
p231_047|A win is a win.
p231_142|It only increased the support for him.
p231_268|I've had the time of my life.
p231_316|We're on our way.
p231_039|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
p231_097|We should recognise others have done a good job.
p231_218|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p231_036|But he can turn on the charm.
p231_217|He has a lot of skill.
p231_391|The response from them was good.
p231_398|They have failed to deliver.
p231_134|You're a gambling man.
p316_400|Well, there you go.
p316_162|Either way, it doesn't bother me.
p316_306|It is an expensive part of their equipment.
p316_373|I know we can play a lot better.
p316_299|I am quite excited about it.
p316_367|It is based on his movement records.
p316_422|We won very easily.
p316_118|I think they have to change that.
p316_261|There were no reported casualties on the ground.
p316_289|He knows what he's got to do.
p316_100|I kept it very simple.
p316_204|He confirmed his fitness.
p316_356|It is time for concerted national action.
p316_127|Their opening was disastrous.
p316_097|I hope it comes out all right.
p316_351|There is a review outgoing at the moment.
p316_341|The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.
p316_125|And now the pressure is off.
p316_043|We accept the challenge.
p316_386|I couldn't get out of bed.
p316_300|Everyone agrees with that.
p316_165|It's got to be in the head.
p316_297|Which brings us to the point.
p316_311|It divided audiences at Cannes.
p316_346|Italy would be lukewarm.
p316_102|It will take several days.
p316_420|They responded in the most positive way.
p316_281|It's all a part of letting it go.
p316_355|Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
p316_374|We said it will happen one night.
p316_381|Is that such a bad thing?
p316_151|They will appear again next week.
p316_240|It is the men who create the demand.
p316_176|And you need to be so resourceful.
p316_116|This is totally untrue.
p316_271|She was so full of life.
p316_234|She said he did not look too happy.
p316_405|I am glad that justice has been done.
p316_163|It would help to heal the wounds.
p316_059|It doesn't look as pretty.
p316_226|However, it proved to be the turning point.
p316_103|We had to push to get a goal.
p316_239|The following year, they asked him again.
p316_378|Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.
p316_038|What a week he has had.
p316_147|And frankly, it's been a while.
p316_115|We will win this tie.
p316_280|So, how did this happen?
p316_061|Everyone was very saddened.
p316_413|I have never been overly ambitious.
p316_149|I hope it is a good omen.
p316_243|It's a scandal, a disgrace.
p316_235|We are aware of the problem.
p316_060|However, our players will fight for that.
p316_057|There was only silence.
p316_160|It was like a dream to be here.
p316_170|None of the opinions is good.
p316_326|He was happy with his form.
p316_138|The case was taken on by his brother.
p316_228|In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.
p316_310|Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.
p316_237|Then it was changed without notice.
p316_277|And he has a tale to tell.
p316_121|It's very ingenious.
p316_009|There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p316_082|Most of them have already gone home.
p316_136|While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.
p316_168|That happens in boxing.
p316_231|Its future is uncertain.
p316_185|That, in a way, is the point.
p316_330|But we will not be scared.
p316_058|However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
p316_252|They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.
p316_040|He is looking for a sporting challenge.
p316_191|I just love lessons.
p316_220|We need a much wider debate.
p316_106|We are making progress on waiting lists.
p316_027|Have we tried everything?
p316_379|However, we let them back into the game.
p316_336|There will be no receivers.
p316_304|I didn't feel good.
p316_084|Weaknesses there are, however.
p316_376|This election is far from over.
p316_230|We all knew it could not be true.
p316_307|Let's get to know him.
p316_217|But is this enough to provoke a killing?
p316_287|Who is to benefit from this change?
p316_034|There will always be problems on the way.
p316_394|There may be hope this year, however.
p316_029|We have worked hard.
p316_415|I hope you don't regret it.
p316_173|He declined to provide a breakdown.
p316_338|The air campaign is not over yet.
p316_275|I am very confident about tomorrow night.
p316_079|The judge was very nice.
p316_294|War and force are not the only solutions.
p316_385|It's time to move on.
p316_303|Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
p316_182|It was the same with the Dickens.
p316_248|They are you, the fans.
p316_155|Things begin to spring to life.
p316_372|It was our time maybe.
p316_032|This is not a war on terror.
p316_218|I didn't just walk in and get it.
p316_108|I did not have faith in the procedures.
p316_396|They are taking a stand against this.
p316_091|There was no bad behaviour.
p316_349|We have to open up.
p316_324|It has to reinvent itself.
p316_137|He is a bully.
p316_049|So, why does he do it?
p316_383|Thousands of people were missing.
p316_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
p316_406|Its first awards will just do that.
p316_265|Another issue will be policing.
p316_134|She is not the world champion.
p316_123|It is all up to the Members.
p316_298|I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
p316_095|Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.
p316_284|The change was not instant.
p316_132|Now, however, things are different.
p316_180|We played better after the break.
p316_031|Naturally, she said yes.
p316_363|Two people have died.
p316_357|Do you know who we are?
p316_418|This is the greatest moment of our lives.
p316_114|She has the biggest part.
p316_257|I have totally had enough.
p316_148|Feel for five seconds.
p316_124|The two sets are different.
p316_205|The gap is narrowing.
p316_370|There is a changing of the guard.
p316_177|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.
p316_112|It has until Saturday.
p316_120|It's great news, isn't it.
p316_051|It is very unfair, and something should be done.
p316_175|I have never seen him like that.
p316_318|The police believe that the man was not injured.
p316_172|They must not succeed.
p316_276|I just wanted to fly.
p316_078|Robin Williams is subdued.
p316_267|This is the biggest surprise of my life.
p316_150|Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
p316_074|We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
p316_369|It left me with sadness.
p316_229|I waited and waited.
p316_366|Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
p316_101|The rest was badminton.
p316_411|It is not that sort of inquiry.
p316_382|You do need a check and a balance.
p316_053|That is not the case this time.
p316_288|We are not defeated.
p316_044|The question is, Will it be enough?
p316_192|Retirement is on his mind.
p316_183|Of course it is still possible.
p316_354|We are doing okay in the league.
p316_189|Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
p316_157|I understood that concern.
p316_093|It's a much bigger problem.
p316_042|I accept that, but is very upsetting.
p316_258|Hopefully today will be the turning point.
p316_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p316_241|I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
p316_207|Both men were uninjured.
p316_272|I should have given him one in return.
p316_094|There are no problems between us at all.
p316_113|I've tried to get on with my life.
p316_161|The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
p316_305|It is believed that he had been stabbed.
p316_249|We're just waiting for her reaction.
p316_206|All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
p316_225|So what could be better than becoming a captain?
p316_259|We shall be ready for Rangers.
p316_274|The princess has strong links with Scotland.
p316_236|Where will the elderly go then?
p316_080|They control the prices paid to farmers.
p262_060|I fell against him.
p262_208|It's a big deal for me.
p262_355|A man has since been charged with his murder.
p318_157|I am not blaming audiences.
p318_050|My brother is buried under there.
p318_424|We have no plans for direct action.
p318_226|From our point of view, it is the right time.
p318_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p318_364|I am amazed at what he's done.
p318_039|It helped to get me noticed.
p318_353|He was made redundant in February last year.
p244_148|I am the manager of Scotland.
p244_418|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
p244_416|There is no need to panic.
p244_112|But he has not become a monster.
p244_250|Sadly, it could not be done.
p244_260|That is not the case in Europe.
p244_328|Another difference is the cost.
p244_387|He will be difficult to replace.
p244_175|All the pressure was on him.
p244_087|It would have been around the turn of the century.
p244_026|It may be good for the soul.
p244_234|It will be decided in the next month.
p244_242|He is a man of the people.
p244_407|It's great that it happened in Britain.
p244_390|He was on a mission.
p244_186|The feeling is hard to describe.
p244_310|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
p244_406|There is a demand for it.
p244_385|Everything is in the mix.
p244_308|Every character was completely different.
p244_173|We were all over the place in the first half.
p244_114|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
p244_264|It expected this trend to continue.
p244_374|However, it does not seem to be the case.
p244_219|THE force is with them.
p244_405|It's all been about the basics of the business.
p244_364|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
p244_351|He is a great prospect.
p244_132|It is hard to believe.
p244_204|It is not an issue.
p244_126|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
p244_235|We have to win the group.
p244_303|We have to be realistic.
p244_052|The pressure on the players will build.
p244_162|There is a lack of staff.
p244_384|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
p244_233|There is a lot of concern.
p244_040|She was at the top.
p244_278|However, the matter is not going to end there.
p244_400|It is the last meeting of the season.
p244_271|But the government has so far failed to listen.
p244_340|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
p244_049|That is still the case.
p244_259|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
p244_380|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
p244_222|He was not injured in the attack.
p244_284|It is important that he is involved.
p244_344|And the context is also completely different.
p244_267|But we were in control at that point.
p244_152|It starts at the top.
p244_254|I was never in danger.
p244_346|The banking sector was weak.
p244_066|There is a lot to be done.
p244_225|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
p244_240|This is a fight to the death.
p244_122|He was not alone at the top of the board.
p244_051|In my view, it has to be done.
p244_108|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
p244_403|He is a quality player.
p244_027|We want to lift the cup for the fans.
p244_404|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
p244_386|An announcement is expected this week.
p244_309|But it is a similar problem.
p244_336|It is a sensitive issue.
p244_103|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
p244_232|Other villages were completely deserted.
p244_372|The news is not all bad.
p244_029|It is about investing in the future.
p244_125|We had a great time.
p244_153|Others are expected to follow the lead.
p244_127|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p244_286|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
p244_354|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
p244_399|I want this one to be different.
p244_221|It was important to win today.
p244_179|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
p244_261|But it was a loss.
p244_229|It still has an effect.
p244_201|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
p244_117|This is a sea change in approach.
p244_092|It sounds a lot of money.
p244_060|We have got to deliver.
p244_090|It seems a good thing to try.
p244_305|There was a hole in it.
p244_319|Look at the potential of this club.
p244_144|I have been in contact with him.
p244_373|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
p244_424|But it was a struggle.
p244_100|This is a game of confidence.
p244_046|It is all about the story.
p244_116|In the end we have to take a stand.
p244_062|The company continues to grow.
p244_045|They are going after them.
p244_170|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
p310_182|I'm not a magician.
p310_379|That is why it's so lyrical.
p310_346|More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.
p310_392|We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
p310_025|He was the youngest of the British team.
p310_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p310_371|Pray that is so.
p310_299|It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p310_267|It's such a trial!
p310_050|Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p310_404|We were close, but not close enough.
p310_395|I don't think it's vital.
p310_286|Is he any good in the kitchen?
p310_096|Now he will have to start again.
p310_314|Boarding school was equally protective.
p310_052|I fell to the ground.
p310_170|Last week, he was taken to the hospital.
p310_126|This is just one example.
p310_248|It's more like a Labour Party rally.
p310_238|Last year was not a good year.
p310_155|We started with that.
p310_098|I don't know how it happened.
p310_191|This is the first job of the director - leadership.
p310_317|Clearly, this was the important nursing.
p310_296|That was the most annoying thing.
p310_339|You need a reason for staying.
p310_263|It really is taken seriously.
p310_394|There was only one hole in it.
p310_179|The club are feeling no different today.
p310_124|Five in a month isn't good enough.
p310_137|People can describe a moment in their life.
p310_153|This is a job for the Government.
p310_358|This is the lowest of the low.
p310_337|I have found my vision.
p310_353|That is of no use.
p310_367|But it's got to be worth it.
p310_147|I've so much respect for him.
p310_283|We're going to change our party.
p310_163|I was over the moon.
p310_420|I think it's a disgrace.
p310_387|They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
p310_372|In fact it isn't related to either.
p310_075|That was then and this is now.
p310_342|I don't expect to see that this time.
p310_041|Buying our way out is not an option.
p310_228|Things are moving together.
p310_113|But there is another side.
p310_357|He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.
p310_133|We don't see it as downgrading.
p310_088|However, it is no longer with the national team.
p310_234|Look at the table.
p310_421|So he should be.
p310_057|All of us know it exists.
p310_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
p310_226|However, it very nearly went wrong.
p310_139|The starting point is pretty unusual.
p310_201|That was the personal impulse.
p310_159|It's never the same problem.
p310_368|But does the same thing happen with music?
p310_103|In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
p310_355|Now it is measuring it in dollars.
p310_059|This is the band.
p310_175|However, you have just got to adjust it.
p310_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p310_390|I didn't actually believe them at first.
p310_026|I fell in love with the ballet.
p310_279|Today's ruling confirms that.
p310_330|It is a high time to act.
p310_350|Or do they?
